				"title": "Regarding Social Media - Don't Split the Difference",
				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out recently how to make social media work better for me. I am stuck between two &ldquo;worlds&rdquo;. On the one hand, I&rsquo;ve got my IRL friends and family who are on the major platforms and don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with something different. On the other hand I&rsquo;ve got the professional and hobby-related communities that share my ideologies around social networking, and that have almost entirely abandoned the major platforms for decentralized, user-controlled ones.</p>\n<p>On a different axis of this investigation, I&rsquo;ve noticed that regardless of platform, my mental wellbeing is supported by simple, one-experience user interfaces. Example: Instagram offers both Stories and Reels / Posts in the same interface. This completely kills the flow for me. Stories are useful in that they highlight content that might otherwise disappear from your feed, but they are also incredibly time consuming to get through, even if you are furiously tapping the &ldquo;next story&rdquo; side of the screen.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Mastodon interface offers an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; view that is reminiscent of TweetDeck and feels like having the Matrix poured into your eyeballs. Even with &ldquo;slow mode&rdquo; enabled, it is not a relaxed scroll through the fediverse. So in both cases, I have dumbed down the interfaces as much as possible. I mute Stories for every account that I follow on IG, and I gladly stick with Mastodon&rsquo;s basic interface.</p>\n<p>Because my groups of interest inhabit different platforms, but the conversations that I want to start are the same across those groups, I&rsquo;m going to settle for cross-posting. And I can say, objectively, that Mastodon supports this perfectly out of the box, while IG, thanks to Meta, only supports this in the douchiest way possible. It&rsquo;s a rant for another day, but if you want to post to your IG account from a 3rd-party cross-posting tool, you <em>must</em>: a) have an FB account, b) have an FB page that links to your IG account, and c) your IG account must be a Creator or Business account.</p>\n<p>So here&rsquo;s where I have to be totally honest with my IRL friends and family: If it weren&rsquo;t for you, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother with IG, FB, or any other centralized platform <em>at all</em>. If you only want to follow me on IG or FB [^1], I&rsquo;m going to support that, but you are not going to have much of an interactive experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&rsquo;m going to cross-post there so that you know what&rsquo;s going on with me</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m going to occasionally check in on the web (not mobile) to see what&rsquo;s going on with you [^2]</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if you want to <em>engage</em> with me like we&rsquo;re a pair of regular social media mavens, let&rsquo;s do it on Mastodon or any other ActivityPub-compliant platform of your choosing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking over the history of my posts about social media, none of these have aged really well 😂 So in order to hopefully increase the longevity of this, here&rsquo;s the key learnings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense to abandon the big centralized platforms. I&rsquo;ve got too many non-techie people in my life who don&rsquo;t want to deal with the perceived challenges of learning something new and different.</li>\n<li>I also don&rsquo;t think it makes sense to go out of my way to engage with people on the big centralized platforms. I don&rsquo;t want to compete with an algorithm. I want to have real conversations with people.</li>\n<li>Less is more. Anything I can do to simplify my experience when interacting with social media makes the platforms more useful and meaningful to me.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another way to say it: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t split the difference&rdquo;. One way in (through a cross-posting tool), simplified experiences (through &ldquo;dumbing down&rdquo; the UIs), and one platform where I will seek engagement with others. Via cross-posting, I can maintain a minimum viable connection to the people that I care about who can&rsquo;t walk away from the centralized platforms that I don&rsquo;t want to use. But that is a lesser experience for them, and I&rsquo;m happier with that than with trying to make it great for everyone.</p>\n<p>[1] Don&rsquo;t bother with Twitter, Bluesky, or Threads. I have accounts there that will lay forever dormant.\n[2] This is mostly relevant for friends and family that I am not talking with regularly. The top reason I maintain an FB account <em>at all</em> is in case one of you ever needs to get in touch with me.</p>",

I mute Stories for every account that I follow on IG, and I gladly stick with Mastodon's basic interface.\n\nBecause my groups of interest inhabit different platforms, but the conversations that I want to start are the same across those groups, I'm going to settle for cross-posting. And I can say, objectively, that Mastodon supports this perfectly out of the box, while IG, thanks to Meta, only supports this in the douchiest way possible. It's a rant for another day, but if you want to post to your IG account from a 3rd-party cross-posting tool, you _must_: a) have an FB account, b) have an FB page that links to your IG account, and c) your IG account must be a Creator or Business account.\n\nSo here's where I have to be totally honest with my IRL friends and family: If it weren't for you, I wouldn't bother with IG, FB, or any other centralized platform _at all_. If you only want to follow me on IG or FB [^1], I'm going to support that, but you are not going to have much of an interactive experience:\n\n* I'm going to cross-post there so that you know what's going on with me\n* I'm going to occasionally check in on the web (not mobile) to see what's going on with you [^2]\n* Otherwise, if you want to _engage_ with me like we're a pair of regular social media mavens, let's do it on Mastodon or any other ActivityPub-compliant platform of your choosing\n\nLooking over the history of my posts about social media, none of these have aged really well 😂 So in order to hopefully increase the longevity of this, here's the key learnings:\n\n1. I don't think it makes sense to abandon the big centralized platforms. I've got too many non-techie people in my life who don't want to deal with the perceived challenges of learning something new and different.\n2. I also don't think it makes sense to go out of my way to engage with people on the big centralized platforms. I don't want to compete with an algorithm. I want to have real conversations with people.\n3. Less is more. Anything I can do to simplify my experience when interacting with social media makes the platforms more useful and meaningful to me.\n\nAnother way to say it: \"don't split the difference\". One way in (through a cross-posting tool), simplified experiences (through \"dumbing down\" the UIs), and one platform where I will seek engagement with others. Via cross-posting, I can maintain a minimum viable connection to the people that I care about who can't walk away from the centralized platforms that I don't want to use. But that is a lesser experience for them, and I'm happier with that than with trying to make it great for everyone.\n\n[1] Don't bother with Twitter, Bluesky, or Threads. I have accounts there that will lay forever dormant.\n[2] This is mostly relevant for friends and family that I am not talking with regularly. The top reason I maintain an FB account _at all_ is in case one of you ever needs to get in touch with me.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When I was a kid, I had some dreams that were so vivid that the sensory experience of them was almost indistinguishable from being awake. On Monday night of this week, I woke up at 3:30 a.m. with a picture-perfect recollection of the dream sequence I had just had. It was so shocking and moving to have that sort of experience after many years of barely remembering any dreams at all. So I did my best to capture what was happening across the whole sequence. On the surface, it&rsquo;s just random shit, but with each section of the dream, things came into sharper and sharper focus until by the end, I was certain that I was awake up to the moment that I actually woke up.</p>\n<p>My dream started a bit like a video game. In a wilderness by a lake, with others - fellow campers? Competitors? It was unclear, but we all moved to the water and used unseen vehicles (tiny, like a jet ski that was so small that you would just hang on and it pulled you through the water) to go elsewhere on the body of water. I rode up the back of a large wave and down the front of it, other campers doing the same. I knew they were there but did not look to the sides to see them. I remember the total sense of exhilaration, the joy of this mode of transport, like body surfing.</p>\n<p>Next I was moving through an arid landscape at dusk. I was aware of giant ape-like beasts in the distance that I gave a wide berth around to avoid. Like a video game, adjacent parts of the terrain were wildly different, and so my wide path led me into an industrial space were I climbed across gangways and ladders around huge pipes like aqueducts to keep moving towards an unspecified goal. I was next heading into some kind of train with beds or cots on it for night travel, though my mind never really formed an image of it.</p>\n<p>At this point, I shifted into a dream within a dream. It was my mother who was gone in this alternate reality, rather than my father. I went into some kind of dream state to see her one last time. In the dream state I walked down from the woods at Flintlock Drive into the back yard of the house next to my childhood best friend’s old house. Super vivid glance at the back of his house to orient myself to my whereabouts. His house was exactly as I remember it; the house next door was totally different from the one that is actually there.</p>\n<p>The inside of that other house was dark and grand. I knew my mother was upstairs and that she was not well. Other adults were there. They were all familiar but I recognized none of them. I sort of understood that there was some role swapping going on. Unfamiliar faces in the roles of friends and family members. People who were there to fill roles and support me a certain way in this inner dream.</p>\n<p>I knew that when I woke up, my mom would be gone. But I would also have had the gift of this ultra-vivid last visit (even though within the inner dream, I didn’t actually experience any of that visit with her). My interactions with the other adults were all of the nature of greetings and sympathies for what was happening with my mother, and me mentally noting who these people were in my ‘real’ life, though I never filled in any specifics.</p>\n<p>One of the adults was a woman in the role of my wife. As with the others, I was acutely aware that she wasn’t my wife, but that regardless, she was a friend who cared about me. I didn’t want to make things awkward for either of us and so our greeting and conversation were quite chaste and not very long. Others played the role of close cousins, perhaps, or close friends. Just not who they actually were.</p>\n<p>After speaking to these familiar people in the house with me, and appreciating them in their alternate roles (which nobody explicitly acknowledged; I just internally understood), I finally went to bed in a dark, first-floor bedroom. Still on the first floor. I never went upstairs. After a brief moment of sleep, I ‘awoke’ in the dream and I was alone in the bed and the same house. The inner dream was over and I awake to the reality that my mom was gone. I was overcome with grief, but also just so filled with appreciation for the gift of that inner dream. The neighborhood was so vividly detailed, and the emotional nature of my relationship with the other adults was so strongly felt.</p>\n<p>I awoke for real in my actual bed, surprised that I hadn’t woken up my actual wife with the sounds of my crying. But my eyes were dry; my expressions of sadness had occurred entirely within the dream. I had to remind myself upon waking that my mother is alive and well, and that it was my father who had passed. It was all so vivid, and the gratitude I felt for the gift of this dream was so deeply felt, that I grabbed the tablet next to my bed to try and capture all of it.</p>\n<p>In the latter part of the dream, all of these people who I felt close to - but didn’t recognize - were there to support me. In a way, it felt like I was glimpsing into a parallel universe where my life had taken a completely different path, and the roles of friends and family had been filled by a completely different set of people.</p>\n<p>Two things moved me to write it all down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The sheer volume of detail that I remembered upon waking up, much more than I’ve been able to remember about my dreams in years</li>\n<li>The overwhelming sense of gratitude that I felt for the gift of that last opportunity to spend time with a parent who was gone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Does it mean anything deeper?

				"title": "December 2022",
				"content_html": "<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin with this month. I have strong emotional reactions to just thinking about it, but why bother trying to capture all of that negativity. I won&rsquo;t appreciate reading it later - if I ever bring myself to reading this particular article later. So I&rsquo;ll just try to capture things in chronological order and leave the rest for future me to work out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"november-27-december-3rd\">November 27-December 3rd</h2>\n<p>This month really started on November 27th, <a href=\"https://nharrisonripps.com/goodbye-dad\">the day my father died</a>. The days that immediately followed were split between my day job and the list of things that you need to do to announce a death and plan a funeral. We set the date of the service to be December 16th. I immediately booked an AirBnB for the weekend of the service so that we&rsquo;d be available to my stepmother.</p>\n<p>Rather randomly, my left foot started to hurt on November 28th, blooming into burning pain through that night into the next day. I went to urgent care and we determined that it wasn&rsquo;t broken and it <em>probably</em> wasn&rsquo;t gout. I finally made an appointment with my PCP on Thursday because my foot had swollen to the point where I could barely put a shoe on it. I started a five day course of steroids and a ten day course of antibiotics that I would be dealing with through Sunday, the 11th. I have a podiatry appointment coming up in January - still no idea what triggered this whole thing.</p>\n<p>My company offers an extremely generous bereavement leave, and the absolute smartest thing I did in that first week was to opt to take the full offered leave of two weeks, starting the following Monday. It effectively meant that I would be taking all of December off. At that point, I was thinking that there would be so much free time for me to just process what my dad&rsquo;s death meant in terms of my own life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"december-4-10\">December 4-10</h2>\n<p>Despite the scramble to get work buttoned up between November 28th and December 2nd, I still had a few work items to address during the first week of bereavement leave. I also needed to spend two days in CT, helping my stepmother to begin going through my father&rsquo;s things, and walking through <em>all</em> of my father&rsquo;s online accounts to delete them or at least remove any credit card information.</p>\n<p>I also tried - for the second and third times - to get snow tires put on my car. Neither trip would be successful due to a miscommunication between the service department and the parts department at the local shop. These departments are literally ten feet from each other.</p>\n<p>To help my stepmother, I also set up all of the cookies-and-fruit-trays catering for the funeral service plus a large catered dinner at a restaurant after the service. My stepmother then canceled the post-service catering and booked her own. Whatever, it&rsquo;s only time, right?</p>\n<p>That weekend was devoted to getting the boys ready both for their ski season and for the funeral. Miraculously, the suits that I bought them for a family engagement over the summer still fit well enough for them to wear to the service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"december-11-17\">December 11-17</h2>\n<p>On Sunday, emboldened by my left foot&rsquo;s recovery from the random swelling situation, I went for my first run since the day that my father died. Easy does it, and it seemed good!</p>\n<p>On Monday I finally managed to get snow tires on the car. The rest of the day was largely devoted to house work - the stuff that you do in a normal week that I hadn&rsquo;t been able to attend to since before Thanksgiving. Plus grocery shopping.</p>\n<p>Tuesday and Wednesday - more funeral prep. Haircuts for me and the boys. Plus a completely ridiculous side plot involving a tradition of matching PJs for Christmas morning (not the ridiculous part), colliding with my mother&rsquo;s unfathomably complicated mental gymnastics when it comes to absolutely <em>everything</em>. She almost killed Christmas, but boy was she going to outdo herself in that department later on.</p>\n<p>Thursday morning I got in my third run of the week and everything seemed cool until the afternoon, when the same kind of minor pain that preceded my major inflammatory problem started to creep up. I called my PCP in a panic to at least get me set up for more steroid if I needed it. By the time we got it all together, I needed to have the prescription sent to a pharmacy in CT so I could pick it up on the way down.</p>\n<p>Thursday evening I brought the boys down to CT to be with their cousins before the funeral. My sister and I synced up with my stepmother. We talked about how to divide and conquer tasks for the following day. Meanwhile, my wife headed to my daughter&rsquo;s college - 2.5 hours in a different direction - to bring her straight to the service the next day.</p>\n<p>Friday was the funeral service. Highlights: first off, some of my friends made the long trip and I am grateful for them. Also, four people spoke about my dad (myself included), and the other three eulogies were first-rate. I&rsquo;ll leave others to rate my own delivery. I will note that my father actually wrote most of the eulogy that I delivered; it was the retirement speech that he never got to give. He always needed to have the last word when talking with me, so I felt obliged to let him have it one last time.</p>\n<p>The catered restaurant dinner after the funeral was a high point. The event coordinator at the restaurant was great to work with. Even when our anticipated guest list of 30 turned out to be only 16, they adapted the plan with no fuss. The food was also great.</p>\n<p>Saturday was largely spent in my dad&rsquo;s basement, going through fishing gear with my sister and a close friend and fishing buddy of my father. But there was also a massive near-disaster. That morning at the AirBnB, I was carrying laundry down the narrow staircase of this ancient farmhouse, and I slipped. I fell down half the flight of stairs and landed hard on my right hip. The iPhone that was in my back pocket was utterly destroyed, and as I write this article ten days afterwards, the massive black bruise that I got from that fall has spread from my hip down to the back of my knee.</p>\n<p>Miraculously, I didn&rsquo;t break my hip. I&rsquo;m not sure if the iPhone&rsquo;s destruction saved my hip or made the injury worse than it would have been otherwise. In any case, I had to add a trip to the Apple Store to the day&rsquo;s activities. Every day since then, the hip has gotten a little better. Between the foot issue and the hip issue, I haven&rsquo;t tried to run. Today I did a 4 mile walk and it feels like a huge win.</p>\n<h2 id=\"december-18-24\">December 18-24</h2>\n<p>Sunday we wrapped up our time in CT with a magic show at a venue I hadn&rsquo;t been to in many years. My stepmother wanted everyone to leave on a high note and so she treated us to this show. I was more excited to see the inside of the venue - a theater where I had seen many of the most memorable movies of my childhood - than the magic show. But I&rsquo;m sure the kids loved it.</p>\n<p>Monday a.m. I drove my daughter and myself to NH to open up the vacation house for Christmas. Monday and Tuesday were blessedly quiet days. I spent them working on my handmade presents for people and binging reality shows. It was glorious. They were really my first opportunity to start decompressing from this crazy month. Wednesday my wife and the boys came up, and the energy levels slowly started ramping up towards all of our Christmas plans.</p>\n<p>Thursday I drove back to MA to collect my mother and drove her back to NH for the holiday. We had made several adaptations to the house to accommodate for my mother&rsquo;s physical limitations - she is still nursing a shoulder replacement that she got back in October. But as is predictably the case, my mother still found things to complain about: temperature of the house, food options, etc.</p>\n<p>By Thursday night the news stations were all covering the upcoming mega storm. It looked like we would be getting it mild compared to the rest of the country - rain, but not snow. The joke was definitely on us.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the day on Friday, things went from mildly stormy to full on emergency. The first issue was the heavy rain. We already had three feet of snow on the ground, so the rain that fell around the house ran through our fieldstone foundation like a sieve. We didn&rsquo;t have significantly deep flooding, but we had a steady stream for hours. My wife and I filled the shop vac with water at least a dozen times as we worked to try and keep the flooding under control.</p>\n<p>The next issue was the wind. The strongest winds were coming across a meadow to the screened in porch side of our house. For the winter time, we had installed large glass panels behind the screens to create a small amount of insulation on the porch. The force of the winds was enough to blow the panels out of their brackets, rendering them useless and also risking to shatter them on the furniture there. I worked with my son to get them laid down on the porch so they would at least not break before the storm was over.</p>\n<p>Finally, when my wife and I were picking up my daughter from her shift at a local hardware store at 6pm, we got a call from my in-laws to let us know that the power had gone out at the house. My wife wisely bought six gallons of water and a flashlight from the hardware store before we headed back to a dark house.</p>\n<p>The rain was all but over, and the flooding in the house was resolving, but a squall line about seventy miles long had taken out power in around 43000 homes in that part of New Hampshire. The power company has a publicly viewable outage map and was providing status updates every twelve hours. I took in all of the data and I sensed that it was going to be a while before power came back.</p>\n<p>This was Friday, the 23rd. We were on the books to host a Christmas Eve party for 30 people the following night. My wife texted the full list of guests to let them know that we were looking forward to their company, but be advised that we would be having our annual Christmas Smorgasbord by candlelight. Props to her crazy viking family, but absolutely all of them were totally on board to proceed with a holiday dinner in a house with no power.</p>\n<p>Friday night into Saturday morning, the house was warm enough that we were all sleeping in our regular beds. When any of us woke up during the night, we would head to the fireplaces and throw another log on. I have a small thermometer in each of the two bathrooms and by the next morning, they were still reading in the high 40s.</p>\n<p>Friday temps were as high as the 50s, but by Saturday night, it was a different story.</p>\n<p>The first dinner party was a success. Between two roaring fireplaces and thirty people packed into the house, we were warm. Thanks to the nature of smorgasbord there were very few dishes that needed to be served hot, and my in-laws had power at their house to do the heating. So we were also well-fed.</p>\n<p>By the time our guests left, however, temperatures had dropped significantly, and the reality of our situation came into focus. Earlier in the day, I had asked my mother if she would be more comfortable in a hotel room on Christmas Eve. I knew it was going to be cold in the house and so I had investigated room availability in nearby towns. Amazingly, she declined. To my mother&rsquo;s credit, she was going to ride out the power outage with us.</p>\n<p>So, we settled in to a long winter&rsquo;s night. It wasn&rsquo;t cozy. We gave up on our second floor rooms, which were already freezing, and settled in around the two fireplaces on the first floor. My wife and I took turns on fire watch the entire night to keep those fireplaces going. I was continuously cold from 8pm on Christmas Eve and throughout the night. The temperatures on those thermometers in the bathrooms kept dipping lower.</p>\n<h2 id=\"december-25---26\">December 25 - 26</h2>\n<p>At 3am on Christmas morning, I awoke with a start. The main fireplace was down to embers, and the secondary fireplace was completely out. I scrambled to get things going again. My fire-tending woke up my wife and my mother. My wife kept an eye on the main fire as I collected my mental faculties to build a fire in the secondary fireplace that would succeed on the first lighting.</p>\n<p>As I knelt in front of this fireplace, blowing on near-dead embers to bring it back to life, I heard feet shuffling behind me. My mom tapped me on the shoulder and said &ldquo;Christmas gifts&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I need to explain that a little. In my mother&rsquo;s family, there is a tradition on Christmas morning. It&rsquo;s a game. The goal of the game is to say the phrase &ldquo;Christmas gifts&rdquo; to the other people in the house before they say it to you. It&rsquo;s like a game of tag. When I became connected to my wife&rsquo;s family, I brought this tradition along with me because it was a special part of the holiday that I enjoyed - even though I was often slow on the draw when it came to getting the words &ldquo;Christmas gifts&rdquo; out.</p>\n<p>This Christmas morning, with temperatures in the house now in the high 30s, with me struggling to light a fire so that we didn&rsquo;t freeze and neither did the plumbing, my mother was&hellip; trying to lighten the mood maybe? Trying to capture a little Christmas spirit? And that was the exact moment where I no longer gave a fuck if it was Christmas. I didn&rsquo;t feel it and I barely had the energy to make any sort of response whatsoever. I got the fire going and went back to the couch for some more fitful sleep.</p>\n<p>At 5am I woke up again. The fires had burned low. The temperature in the bathrooms was 34 degrees Fahrenheit. It wasn&rsquo;t going to get any colder outside, but all I could think about was the next night.

With no power, we still had a lot of leftover dishes from the Smorgasbord. Our in-laws had made a dent by bringing some back to their house, but we were still behind.

Even as other family members seemed to be making the decision on her behalf, she was resolute in waiting to see how the day unfolded. For my own part, I knew only two things: first off - that I had barely enough energy to focus on anything but keeping our house above freezing, and second off - that I would support my wife&rsquo;s wishes even if I didn&rsquo;t think it would be possible to host another dinner in our house.</p>\n<p>At 1:30 in the afternoon, as I prepared to drive over to my in-laws' house for a shower, the power in the house came back on.

				"content_text": "I don't even know where to begin with this month. I have strong emotional reactions to just thinking about it, but why bother trying to capture all of that negativity. I won't appreciate reading it later - if I ever bring myself to reading this particular article later. So I'll just try to capture things in chronological order and leave the rest for future me to work out.\n<!--more-->\n## November 27-December 3rd\nThis month really started on November 27th, [the day my father died](https://nharrisonripps.com/goodbye-dad). The days that immediately followed were split between my day job and the list of things that you need to do to announce a death and plan a funeral. We set the date of the service to be December 16th. I immediately booked an AirBnB for the weekend of the service so that we'd be available to my stepmother.\n\nRather randomly, my left foot started to hurt on November 28th, blooming into burning pain through that night into the next day. I went to urgent care and we determined that it wasn't broken and it _probably_ wasn't gout. I finally made an appointment with my PCP on Thursday because my foot had swollen to the point where I could barely put a shoe on it. I started a five day course of steroids and a ten day course of antibiotics that I would be dealing with through Sunday, the 11th. I have a podiatry appointment coming up in January - still no idea what triggered this whole thing.\n\nMy company offers an extremely generous bereavement leave, and the absolute smartest thing I did in that first week was to opt to take the full offered leave of two weeks, starting the following Monday. It effectively meant that I would be taking all of December off. At that point, I was thinking that there would be so much free time for me to just process what my dad's death meant in terms of my own life.\n\n## December 4-10\nDespite the scramble to get work buttoned up between November 28th and December 2nd, I still had a few work items to address during the first week of bereavement leave. I also needed to spend two days in CT, helping my stepmother to begin going through my father's things, and walking through _all_ of my father's online accounts to delete them or at least remove any credit card information.\n\nI also tried - for the second and third times - to get snow tires put on my car. Neither trip would be successful due to a miscommunication between the service department and the parts department at the local shop. These departments are literally ten feet from each other.\n\nTo help my stepmother, I also set up all of the cookies-and-fruit-trays catering for the funeral service plus a large catered dinner at a restaurant after the service. My stepmother then canceled the post-service catering and booked her own. Whatever, it's only time, right?\n\nThat weekend was devoted to getting the boys ready both for their ski season and for the funeral. Miraculously, the suits that I bought them for a family engagement over the summer still fit well enough for them to wear to the service.\n\n## December 11-17\nOn Sunday, emboldened by my left foot's recovery from the random swelling situation, I went for my first run since the day that my father died. Easy does it, and it seemed good!\n\nOn Monday I finally managed to get snow tires on the car. The rest of the day was largely devoted to house work - the stuff that you do in a normal week that I hadn't been able to attend to since before Thanksgiving. Plus grocery shopping.\n\nTuesday and Wednesday - more funeral prep. Haircuts for me and the boys. Plus a completely ridiculous side plot involving a tradition of matching PJs for Christmas morning (not the ridiculous part), colliding with my mother's unfathomably complicated mental gymnastics when it comes to absolutely _everything_. She almost killed Christmas, but boy was she going to outdo herself in that department later on.\n\nThursday morning I got in my third run of the week and everything seemed cool until the afternoon, when the same kind of minor pain that preceded my major inflammatory problem started to creep up. I called my PCP in a panic to at least get me set up for more steroid if I needed it. By the time we got it all together, I needed to have the prescription sent to a pharmacy in CT so I could pick it up on the way down.\n\nThursday evening I brought the boys down to CT to be with their cousins before the funeral. My sister and I synced up with my stepmother. We talked about how to divide and conquer tasks for the following day. Meanwhile, my wife headed to my daughter's college - 2.5 hours in a different direction - to bring her straight to the service the next day.\n\nFriday was the funeral service. Highlights: first off, some of my friends made the long trip and I am grateful for them. Also, four people spoke about my dad (myself included), and the other three eulogies were first-rate. I'll leave others to rate my own delivery. I will note that my father actually wrote most of the eulogy that I delivered; it was the retirement speech that he never got to give. He always needed to have the last word when talking with me, so I felt obliged to let him have it one last time.\n\nThe catered restaurant dinner after the funeral was a high point. The event coordinator at the restaurant was great to work with. Even when our anticipated guest list of 30 turned out to be only 16, they adapted the plan with no fuss. The food was also great.\n\nSaturday was largely spent in my dad's basement, going through fishing gear with my sister and a close friend and fishing buddy of my father. But there was also a massive near-disaster. That morning at the AirBnB, I was carrying laundry down the narrow staircase of this ancient farmhouse, and I slipped. I fell down half the flight of stairs and landed hard on my right hip. The iPhone that was in my back pocket was utterly destroyed, and as I write this article ten days afterwards, the massive black bruise that I got from that fall has spread from my hip down to the back of my knee.\n\nMiraculously, I didn't break my hip. I'm not sure if the iPhone's destruction saved my hip or made the injury worse than it would have been otherwise. In any case, I had to add a trip to the Apple Store to the day's activities. Every day since then, the hip has gotten a little better. Between the foot issue and the hip issue, I haven't tried to run. Today I did a 4 mile walk and it feels like a huge win.\n\n## December 18-24\nSunday we wrapped up our time in CT with a magic show at a venue I hadn't been to in many years. My stepmother wanted everyone to leave on a high note and so she treated us to this show. I was more excited to see the inside of the venue - a theater where I had seen many of the most memorable movies of my childhood - than the magic show. But I'm sure the kids loved it.\n\nMonday a.m. I drove my daughter and myself to NH to open up the vacation house for Christmas. Monday and Tuesday were blessedly quiet days. I spent them working on my handmade presents for people and binging reality shows. It was glorious. They were really my first opportunity to start decompressing from this crazy month. Wednesday my wife and the boys came up, and the energy levels slowly started ramping up towards all of our Christmas plans.\n\nThursday I drove back to MA to collect my mother and drove her back to NH for the holiday. We had made several adaptations to the house to accommodate for my mother's physical limitations - she is still nursing a shoulder replacement that she got back in October. But as is predictably the case, my mother still found things to complain about: temperature of the house, food options, etc.\n\nBy Thursday night the news stations were all covering the upcoming mega storm. It looked like we would be getting it mild compared to the rest of the country - rain, but not snow. The joke was definitely on us.\n\nOver the course of the day on Friday, things went from mildly stormy to full on emergency. The first issue was the heavy rain. We already had three feet of snow on the ground, so the rain that fell around the house ran through our fieldstone foundation like a sieve. We didn't have significantly deep flooding, but we had a steady stream for hours. My wife and I filled the shop vac with water at least a dozen times as we worked to try and keep the flooding under control.\n\nThe next issue was the wind. The strongest winds were coming across a meadow to the screened in porch side of our house. For the winter time, we had installed large glass panels behind the screens to create a small amount of insulation on the porch. The force of the winds was enough to blow the panels out of their brackets, rendering them useless and also risking to shatter them on the furniture there. I worked with my son to get them laid down on the porch so they would at least not break before the storm was over.\n\nFinally, when my wife and I were picking up my daughter from her shift at a local hardware store at 6pm, we got a call from my in-laws to let us know that the power had gone out at the house. My wife wisely bought six gallons of water and a flashlight from the hardware store before we headed back to a dark house.\n\nThe rain was all but over, and the flooding in the house was resolving, but a squall line about seventy miles long had taken out power in around 43000 homes in that part of New Hampshire. The power company has a publicly viewable outage map and was providing status updates every twelve hours. I took in all of the data and I sensed that it was going to be a while before power came back.\n\nThis was Friday, the 23rd.

				"content_html": "<p>My father passed away yesterday. I&rsquo;m still very numb about the whole thing, still processing, but I didn&rsquo;t want this moment to go by without some writing. Going through old articles from a previous version of this blog, I found something I wrote about my dad on the occasion of his retirement from performing surgeries in 2008. I&rsquo;m reposting it here for posterity.  Rest in peace, Dad,</p>\n<h2 id=\"its-who-you-are\">It&rsquo;s Who You Are</h2>\n<p>[Originally published on May 6th, 2008]</p>\n<p>Last Friday, my dad performed the last surgery of a career that has spanned over thirty years. By my conservative guess, based on a minimum of two scheduled surgeries per week plus countless emergency room calls, his total career count would have to be somewhere in the vicinity of 5000 operations. For the obvious reason that I have no place in an operating room, I never saw his work first hand, but I have looked over his shoulder at the never-ending x-rays of anonymous reconstructed knees, hips and hands. To me, they were bones and screws, plates and stitches. To him, they were his craft, his passion, his profound responsibility.</p>\n<p>It is hard to understand, as a software engineer, what it means to be a surgeon. Most of the engineers I know weren&rsquo;t required to pour their souls into their studies in order to make it. We may have pulled the odd all-nighter, but none of us had to endure multi-year residencies with 72-hour work shifts. We rarely (if ever) have to make life-and-death decisions, much less in a split-second.</p>\n<p>So demanding is the training to become a surgeon that for those who achieve it, being a surgeon is truly who they <em>are</em>. Not too many software engineers are software engineers the way that surgeons are surgeons. This makes it all the more difficult to say that it is time to stop, because what are you if you are not toiling under the responsibility that your patients have entrusted you with? What are you if you are not working with the scalpel and the volumes of experience that you have amassed?</p>\n<p>I believe that when you retire from surgical practice, you are yet a surgeon. My dad was born a surgeon and some day he will die a surgeon. He is and has been many other things&ndash;a dad to me and my sister first and foremost&ndash;but the fire that burns in his eyes was lit for the day when he earned the right and the awesome responsibilities of surgical practice and it will never be extinguished. For the rest of his life, memories of the sleepless nights and hardest cases will stay with him along with the faces of the thousands of people who put their trust in him and were better for it.</p>\n<p>Today, on his birthday, his office staff gave him a huge, handmade quilt; each panel depicted a milestone from his entire medical career. A week from Friday, my dad is being honored as Surgeon of the Year by the Connecticut Orthopedic Society. After all of that, he&rsquo;ll be back at his office practice and continuing his work as an independent medical examiner. Some day I imagine my dad might even decide to retire completely, but a part of his mind and his heart never will.</p>\n<p>In my heart of hearts, one my dad&rsquo;s grandchildren (Linnea, Solomon, or any of the ones to follow) will discover that like their grandpa, they were born a surgeon.

				"content_text": "My father passed away yesterday. I'm still very numb about the whole thing, still processing, but I didn't want this moment to go by without some writing. Going through old articles from a previous version of this blog, I found something I wrote about my dad on the occasion of his retirement from performing surgeries in 2008. I'm reposting it here for posterity.  Rest in peace, Dad,\n\n## It's Who You Are\n[Originally published on May 6th, 2008]\n\nLast Friday, my dad performed the last surgery of a career that has spanned over thirty years. By my conservative guess, based on a minimum of two scheduled surgeries per week plus countless emergency room calls, his total career count would have to be somewhere in the vicinity of 5000 operations. For the obvious reason that I have no place in an operating room, I never saw his work first hand, but I have looked over his shoulder at the never-ending x-rays of anonymous reconstructed knees, hips and hands. To me, they were bones and screws, plates and stitches. To him, they were his craft, his passion, his profound responsibility.\n\nIt is hard to understand, as a software engineer, what it means to be a surgeon. Most of the engineers I know weren't required to pour their souls into their studies in order to make it. We may have pulled the odd all-nighter, but none of us had to endure multi-year residencies with 72-hour work shifts. We rarely (if ever) have to make life-and-death decisions, much less in a split-second.\n\nSo demanding is the training to become a surgeon that for those who achieve it, being a surgeon is truly who they _are_. Not too many software engineers are software engineers the way that surgeons are surgeons. This makes it all the more difficult to say that it is time to stop, because what are you if you are not toiling under the responsibility that your patients have entrusted you with? What are you if you are not working with the scalpel and the volumes of experience that you have amassed?\n\nI believe that when you retire from surgical practice, you are yet a surgeon. My dad was born a surgeon and some day he will die a surgeon. He is and has been many other things--a dad to me and my sister first and foremost--but the fire that burns in his eyes was lit for the day when he earned the right and the awesome responsibilities of surgical practice and it will never be extinguished. For the rest of his life, memories of the sleepless nights and hardest cases will stay with him along with the faces of the thousands of people who put their trust in him and were better for it.\n\nToday, on his birthday, his office staff gave him a huge, handmade quilt; each panel depicted a milestone from his entire medical career. A week from Friday, my dad is being honored as Surgeon of the Year by the Connecticut Orthopedic Society. After all of that, he'll be back at his office practice and continuing his work as an independent medical examiner. Some day I imagine my dad might even decide to retire completely, but a part of his mind and his heart never will.\n\nIn my heart of hearts, one my dad's grandchildren (Linnea, Solomon, or any of the ones to follow) will discover that like their grandpa, they were born a surgeon. I certainly won't know what to do with them, but my dad will. He'll give them a piece of that fire to carry on through the long, hard hours, the many years of school, and the most difficult split-second decisions.\n\nAnd if all of this was no indication--I am incredibly proud to have a dad who has accomplished so much and who has helped so many people.\n",

Unlike most of the young men and women going through in-processing that day in Boston, I was already a college graduate, I was already married, and I wasn&rsquo;t exactly young. I was twenty-eight years old. Had a full-time job as a software engineer, had a mortgage. What motivated me to join was a sense that I could be doing more to serve others. It was just after 9/11 and I felt like it was something I could do.</p>\n<p>Later that year I shipped off to Ft. Knox, Kentucky for Basic Combat Training a.k.a &ldquo;Boot Camp&rdquo;. I could tell a lot of stories about my ten weeks in boot camp, but for the sake of the main point I want to make, I&rsquo;ll limit myself to just one piece of color commentary:</p>\n<p>As part of boot camp, you get tear gassed. In groups of ten we went into a gas-filled bunker wearing gas masks, took them off, and then had to purge and re-wear the masks inside of the tear gas cloud. Tear gas is a respiratory irritant that attacks your mucous membranes. It was like eating hot peppers and then pouring the juice into your nose and eyes. It really reminded me of some of the spiciest foods I&rsquo;d ever eaten, to the extent that when I was finally outside of the bunker, riding the adrenaline rush, I shouted &ldquo;HOT SAUCE, BABY!&rdquo; I have video evidence of that moment. The drill sergeants were grudgingly impressed.</p>\n<p>But I think the biggest lesson of boot camp is that you get to find out what kind of person you are under tremendous stress. I&rsquo;m talking about full physical and mental stress: complete exhaustion, calorie depletion, with people shouting in your face while you attempt to do attention-demanding tasks like disassembling and reassembling rifles, walking security patrols, throwing grenades. And I found out that I was more afraid of making a mistake in front of my drill sergeants than I was of anything else that I was doing there. So of course, several weeks in, my big moment of total physical and mental breakdown was right in front of one of my drill sergeants.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t remember too much about it. Mostly I just remember that I was a terrible athlete growing up and that I was therefore terrible at throwing things. This never mattered as a software engineer but when the task is to throw a live grenade, your ability to throw an object suddenly gets pretty important. And say what you will about the Army but they&rsquo;re not going to put a live grenade in the hands of someone who hasn&rsquo;t succesfully thrown a couple of dummy grenades first.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make excuses for myself here. I was doing a pretty bad job with this. The first failure was no big deal but the third&hellip; and then the fourth&hellip; And when my drill sergeant took me aside for a little pep talk, I just flipped out on him. I was in &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; mode but I had chosen option C: &ldquo;bitter sarchasm&rdquo; with a dash of &ldquo;if you are going to hit me, then just f*ing do it&rdquo;. In their defense, none of my drill sergeants had ever hit me. And this one wouldn&rsquo;t have needed to at that moment, anyway - because if there was some game of wits going on, I had already lost.</p>\n<p>My drill sergeant was a fully frightening human being, but out there on the training grounds he just looked at me and told me to get my sh<em>t together. So, I got my sh</em>t together and went back through the training until I qualified. And later that day, I threw a live grenade over a bunker wall. And that was that. On to the next training module. I graduated boot camp some weeks later, and while I am fortunate to say that grenade throwing has never benefitted me in any part of my life, I think about that training day every once in a while.</p>\n<p>On our best days, making good decisions and being super productive comes easily. On our worst days, nothing is easy. I think it is impossible to avoid bad days; they happen to everyone. But learning how to recognize bad days, understanding your own natural tendencies under those conditions, and giving yourself some grace in how you feel.. maybe these add up to a version of you that isn&rsquo;t perfect, but is still the kind of person you really want to be. I can thank boot camp for showing me what I am like at my worst, and twenty years later I&rsquo;d like to believe that I&rsquo;ve gotten better and better at recognizing those low moments before they spill out and make things worse for me and the people that depend on me.</p>\n<p>Ever since boot camp, my go-to measure for how bad my day is going is pretty straightforward. No, I don&rsquo;t remind myself about my bad day with the grenades. It is much easier to size up the current situation and ask myself: &ldquo;hey, is this better or worse than getting tear gassed?&rdquo; A little healthy perspective goes a long way.</p>",

The drill sergeants were grudgingly impressed.\n\nBut I think the biggest lesson of boot camp is that you get to find out what kind of person you are under tremendous stress. I'm talking about full physical and mental stress: complete exhaustion, calorie depletion, with people shouting in your face while you attempt to do attention-demanding tasks like disassembling and reassembling rifles, walking security patrols, throwing grenades. And I found out that I was more afraid of making a mistake in front of my drill sergeants than I was of anything else that I was doing there. So of course, several weeks in, my big moment of total physical and mental breakdown was right in front of one of my drill sergeants.\n\nI don't remember too much about it. Mostly I just remember that I was a terrible athlete growing up and that I was therefore terrible at throwing things. This never mattered as a software engineer but when the task is to throw a live grenade, your ability to throw an object suddenly gets pretty important. And say what you will about the Army but they're not going to put a live grenade in the hands of someone who hasn't succesfully thrown a couple of dummy grenades first.\n\nI'm not going to make excuses for myself here. I was doing a pretty bad job with this. The first failure was no big deal but the third... and then the fourth... And when my drill sergeant took me aside for a little pep talk, I just flipped out on him. I was in \"fight or flight\" mode but I had chosen option C: \"bitter sarchasm\" with a dash of \"if you are going to hit me, then just f*ing do it\". In their defense, none of my drill sergeants had ever hit me. And this one wouldn't have needed to at that moment, anyway - because if there was some game of wits going on, I had already lost.\n\nMy drill sergeant was a fully frightening human being, but out there on the training grounds he just looked at me and told me to get my sh*t together. So, I got my sh*t together and went back through the training until I qualified. And later that day, I threw a live grenade over a bunker wall. And that was that. On to the next training module. I graduated boot camp some weeks later, and while I am fortunate to say that grenade throwing has never benefitted me in any part of my life, I think about that training day every once in a while.\n\nOn our best days, making good decisions and being super productive comes easily. On our worst days, nothing is easy. I think it is impossible to avoid bad days; they happen to everyone. But learning how to recognize bad days, understanding your own natural tendencies under those conditions, and giving yourself some grace in how you feel.. maybe these add up to a version of you that isn't perfect, but is still the kind of person you really want to be. I can thank boot camp for showing me what I am like at my worst, and twenty years later I'd like to believe that I've gotten better and better at recognizing those low moments before they spill out and make things worse for me and the people that depend on me.\n\nEver since boot camp, my go-to measure for how bad my day is going is pretty straightforward. No, I don't remind myself about my bad day with the grenades. It is much easier to size up the current situation and ask myself: \"hey, is this better or worse than getting tear gassed?\" A little healthy perspective goes a long way.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>We lost Mia today. I’ve always read posts like this with some amount of indifference because in the back of my head I am thinking “this is just an animal” and “this is not a person”. And so I forgive you for feeling the same way. I understand that response.</p>\n<p>This stream of thoughts is really for me, and it is also for my wife and kids and anyone else who feels the loss of our “just a cat” as acutely as I am feeling it right now. But maybe you’ve been here, too, with your pets, at the end of a chapter in your own life. Here is a rememberance for us.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mia and her sister Pia came into our lives on March 15th, 2002. I remember this day well because it was the Ides of March and by an ironic coincidence, I spent that day at the enlistment center in Boston, signing up to join the Army National Guard. The cats were originally found in a cardboard box by a dumpster, and their age at the time that they came home to us was estimated to be eight months.</p>\n<p>We had no children yet, we were both working, and I was going to be disappearing for two and a half months to go to basic training. My wife wanted (and still wants) a dog, but I knew our lifestyle couldn’t work with dogs. Mia and Pia were the compromise.</p>\n<p>Despite being part of the same litter, Mia and Pia couldn’t have been less alike. Pia was a long haired cat, mostly gray with dark streaks. Mia was the classic black and white tabby cat. Pia was a normal-sized, aggressive, dominating cat. Mia never grew past the size of a kitten, and spent her youth quietly in her sister’s shadow.</p>\n<p>The cats were raised to be indoor-outdoor cats and spent many a night out and about in our neighborhood. The extent of their range was not obvious to us until, a few years later, Pia had gone missing for a few days. A neighbor, some streets away from us, put up a poster about the dead cat they had found meeting Pia’s description.</p>\n<p>I went to discover that Pia had been hit by a car and died instantly. The posters that our distant neighbor had put up were a great kindness; otherwise we may never have known her fate.</p>\n<p>Pia was like the wild rocker of the pair; she lived hard and died young. We were sad then, but we were young and busy raising the first of our children as well. We had much to distract us from the loss. Our house was also in a densely populated residential area, so rather than burying her in our tiny yard, we opted to have Pia cremated. We had no specific plans about where or when to bury, and so she has resided in an urn on our bookcase ever since.</p>\n<p>In Pia’s absence, Mia came into her own as the quiet, methodical hunter that I will fondly remember. Her small size was no shortcoming in the business of mousing, but she was equally as gentle and loving with her humans. She lived out her best years in and around the house, occasionally tying up with other cats or critters in the neighborhood, but mostly just lording over the creatures in our own yard.</p>\n<p>For each of our children, during their infancy Mia showed incredible patience and tolerance with their poking and prodding. Her reactions were always tempered to a level that was appropriate to the age of the kids. At night, she could often be found curled up beside one of them. She would follow them up to the house of our friends and neighbors and wait for the kids outside (or even inside, on occasion).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few years ago we got the first indication that her kidneys were failing. We were able to manage this with special food and for her own part, Mia was still herself. Around a year ago, we had a much bigger scare when I found a large, open abscess on her abdomen. Our best guess is that this was the result of a scrape with one of the other animals in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The timing of her abdominal injury was tough; it came right in the midst of our house move and so we were making vet visits with her one hour and frantically packing the next. But eventually, everything settled out. Mia’s wound was treated and healing, and we were in the new house. Our vet, who had cared for both cats from the beginning, left us with stern instructions that Mia could no longer be an outdoor cat at the new place.</p>\n<p>At first, Mia didn’t take kindly to being sequestered, but she was slowing down and ultimately seemed to accept the indoor lifestyle. Part of me wonders now if she might have preferred to be outdoors at the end, but the lack of closure for our kids would have been pretty hard. It will be hard enough as it is.</p>\n<p>Over this past summer, my wife brought a new cat into the family. Mia and Pia were already around eight months old when they came to us, but this new cat was very much a young kitten. With Gus, as we’ve come to call him, Mia made it clear from the start that she would not suffer to live again in another cat’s shadow. Even when the kitten had grown to twice her size in six months, she held her ground against his frequent ambushes and games.</p>\n<p>The squabbling was tiresome for Mia, but she had another big health problem brewing. By January, Mia was showing some occasional shortness of breath. By late February, breathing was starting to become a real effort for her.</p>\n<p>This past Wednesday, Mia’s new vet confirmed that her chest cavity was filled with fluid. The two likely causes were cancer, or congestive heart failure. In a cat that is already dealing with full blown kidney disease, both of these possibilities are pretty bad. We’d never had to face this part of pet ownership before, but now we had to ask ourselves how far we were willing to go to treat this.</p>\n<p>With cancer it would have only been a matter of time, and a pretty miserable time at that. With heart failure alone we might have managed it, but the heart failure combined with kidney failure is a difficult balancing act. I don’t believe that we could have stayed on top of the fine tuning that lies between the opposing treatment plans. Either way would have been a really miserable way to go.</p>\n<p>They gave Mia a diuretic on Wednesday to see if it would reduce the fluid in her chest cavity. I spent a half hour Wednesday night just laying the bed with Mia laying on my chest, as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. Yesterday there was no obvious change in her condition, and so we set up the appointment for her to be put to sleep today. My wife let the kids know what was going to happen, and that it was time to start saying our goodbyes. That went about as well as you could expect.</p>\n<p>We skipped the kidney-friendly food. Mia had a can of tuna for dinner last night, and she spent her last night curled up on the couch with my wife. This morning she got another can of tuna for breakfast. She ate both with gusto.</p>\n<p>But this morning was tough; I don’t think the kids completely grasped that they would leave for school and Mia would be gone when they got home. After they left, I took my breakfast with Mia on my lap, my wife sitting nearby. When it was time go, she held Mia while I got the cat carrier together, and then we sat for a long, tearful moment before I set Mia in her crate.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I will not lie or play down the fact that I was, and still am, a complete wreck. I lost it when I sat down in the car, but I pulled it together for our ten minute drive. As we rode, I told Mia that it was beautiful day, and that we were family, and that we’d had fourteen wonderful years. I told Mia that there was a sunbeam waiting for her past the mounting discomfort of this illness. And I lost it again for a bit, but pulled myself together for the vet’s office.</p>\n<p>We went straight in to the exam room. I took Mia out of the crate and into my lap so we could sit there together. Not long afterward, a tech came in with a form for me to sign and to give me information about the cremation service we would be using. A moment later, the doctor was with us, and she explained the process we were about to undertake.</p>\n<p>The first shot that they give is a heavy anesthetic. For a cat like Mia it takes about three minutes to set in, and when it has taken effect, the cat is in a deep sleep and totally unconscious. The second shot they give, intravenously, is essentially an overdose of anesthetic that is powerful enough to stop the cat’s heart.</p>\n<p>After they gave Mia the first shot, they left us alone while the medicine set in. I wanted this cat to feel loved and comfortable on her way out, and so I just held her and stroked her fur, and started telling telling her about that sunbeam that she would find.</p>\n<p>“You are a sweet little cat. Any time that sun hits my face, we’ll be sitting in it together. I’ll find you in a sunbeam…”</p>\n<p>And then I just started to acknowledge this deep gratitude that I felt for her:</p>\n<p>“Thank you for being there for each of my kids, laying with them as they slept, watching them grow up. Thank you for being there for my wife when I went off to boot camp and she was alone. Thank you for being a part of my life… Thank you, thank you. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Mia had been purring as I stroked her and talked to her, but eventually the purring slowed and then stopped, her body slackened, and I could feel that she was in a deep, relaxed sleep.</p>\n<p>When the doctor and the tech returned, I layed her on the examination table so that they could run a line for her second shot. Laying there, I could see that she was barely bigger than the first time I saw her fourteen years ago. As the medicine went in, her lungs rattled a bit from the effort of breathing, and then Mia was gone.</p>\n<p>They left me again to say my last goodbyes, and the moment they were out the door I well and truly lost it. I had the foresight to bring along a tea towel and I was using it to cover my ragged breaths as the tears streamed down my face. Eventually I collected myself and stood there for a while, stroking Mia’s fur until I was reasonably confident that I could walk to the car without losing it again.</p>\n<p>My last glimpse of Mia was of the tech coming in to take care of her. She was speaking kind words to Mia and I appreciated the care and respect that she and the vet had exhbited through the whole business.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>My father, who has owned and had to say goodbye to a few pets over the years, observed to me once that the span of a pet’s life is like a chapter in our own lives. Mia’s chapter was the beginning of our time as adults with a home and a family – first with cats, and then with children of our own. Mia’s chapter closed in a new house, with our first child on the verge of being a teenager.</p>\n<p>Back at the old house, we never had a plan for burying Pia. Maybe, without really knowing it, we were waiting to bury Mia and Pia together. Now we’ve got enough land to make a proper memorial garden for both of the sisters. When Mia’s ashes come home, we’ll find a nice spot and we’ll make sure that it’s a spot that gets plenty of sun. I think that the combination of being outdoors <em>and</em> laying in a sunbeam is as close to Nirvana as Pia and Mia could get.%</p>",

All told, my first year in this role has been a tremendous learning experience for me. If you are interested in becoming a part of a team like this one, here is some advice for you based on the dozens of interviews I have conducted over my first 15 months.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## 1. Do Your Homework\n\nA little basic Googling will reveal that I currently work for Red Hat and that I am involved with the [Project Atomic][2] and [OpenShift][3] projects, both of which are open-source and are hosted on [GitHub][4]. If one of our awesome recruiters sets you up for an interview with me, they will _also_ tell you about these projects.

It also provides a full-screen app / screen switching model that is ver similar to OS X, which makes changing desktops easier for Mac users.</p>\n<p>I called out some great default OS X apps above; here’s my replacement plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For Mail, <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary\">Geary</a>. Geary provides a very similar conversation-based mail display model and works perfectly with Gmail. My one wish-list item for Geary: let me map IMAP folders to the “special” folders so that you can treat my “Archive” folder on the work server the same way you treat “All Mail” on Gmail.</li>\n<li>For Calendar, <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/California\">California</a>.

For work tasks I’m mostly using <a href=\"https://www.wunderlist.com/\">Wunderlist</a> because there are clients for Linux (via Chrome) and iOS.

They were a boutique PC manufacturer that made high-end gaming computers. They were bought by HP and after that, Voodoo continued to be associated with HP’s bleeding edge laptops and desktops. These days, the “Voodoo” name has disappeared from HP’s product portfolio, but their DNA remains in products like the <a href=\"http://store.hp.com/us/en/SearchDisplay?searchTerm=omen&amp;search=%25EF%2580%25A1&amp;beginIndex=0&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;charset=utf-8&amp;langId=-1&amp;pageSize=50&amp;pageView=grid&amp;resultCatEntryType=2&amp;sType=SimpleSearch&amp;searchSource=Q&amp;storeId=10151%25\">Omen 15</a>“.</p>\n<p>Like the MacBook, the Omen features an all-aluminum body and a solid-state hard drive.

Now, a major argument in favor of Apple has always been that they don’t charge for OS upgrades and Windows does, but in this case, 1) I’m using Linux as primary, so that’s moot, and 2) Windows 10 is also going to be a free upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Linux Hardware Support</strong><br>\nI actually ran Fedora directly on a MacBook Air for a while, but the hardware support is not rock solid. Most notably, Apple’s choice of a PCI-based webcam with no open source drivers meant that I could never videoconference from my laptop. These are non-issues on the Omen.</p>\n<p><strong>Business in the Front, Party in the Back</strong><br>\nThe Omen has an almost embrassing amount of LED-driven “bling lighting”. It has LEDs backlighting the keyboard (which is pretty standard), but also in the speakers and fan exhaust ports. Happily, I can turn all of that off in “work mode” under Linux. The Omen doesn’t need it to stand out and look like an awesome laptop. But hey, when I flip it over to the “gaming OS”? Yeah, I’m cranking up the LEDs 🙂</p>\n<h3 id=\"return-on-investment\">Return on Investment?</h3>\n<p>Time will tell if I’m going to miss OS X. From the OS / apps side, I think I’ve found a combination that works well between a Linux laptop and an iOS phone, and on the hardware side, I feel like I’ve found a system with the same solid build as a MacBook.</p>\n<p>The first time I spin up OpenShift directly on my laptop – that’s going to be a win.</p>",

Now, a major argument in favor of Apple has always been that they don’t charge for OS upgrades and Windows does, but in this case, 1) I’m using Linux as primary, so that’s moot, and 2) Windows 10 is also going to be a free upgrade.\n\n**Better Linux Hardware Support**  \nI actually ran Fedora directly on a MacBook Air for a while, but the hardware support is not rock solid. Most notably, Apple’s choice of a PCI-based webcam with no open source drivers meant that I could never videoconference from my laptop. These are non-issues on the Omen.\n\n**Business in the Front, Party in the Back**  \nThe Omen has an almost embrassing amount of LED-driven “bling lighting”. It has LEDs backlighting the keyboard (which is pretty standard), but also in the speakers and fan exhaust ports. Happily, I can turn all of that off in “work mode” under Linux. The Omen doesn’t need it to stand out and look like an awesome laptop. But hey, when I flip it over to the “gaming OS”? Yeah, I’m cranking up the LEDs 🙂\n\n### Return on Investment?\n\nTime will tell if I’m going to miss OS X. From the OS / apps side, I think I’ve found a combination that works well between a Linux laptop and an iOS phone, and on the hardware side, I feel like I’ve found a system with the same solid build as a MacBook.\n\nThe first time I spin up OpenShift directly on my laptop – that’s going to be a win.\n\n [1]: https://openshift.com\n [2]: http://boot2docker.io/\n [3]: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary\n [4]: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/California\n [5]: https://www.wunderlist.com/\n [6]: http://simplenote.com/\n [7]: http://zim-wiki.org/\n [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoodooPC\n [9]: http://store.hp.com/us/en/SearchDisplay?searchTerm=omen&search=%25EF%2580%25A1&beginIndex=0&catalogId=10051&charset=utf-8&langId=-1&pageSize=50&pageView=grid&resultCatEntryType=2&sType=SimpleSearch&searchSource=Q&storeId=10151%             \n",

Have a look at <a href=\"https://write.as/harrisonripps/os-x-to-fedora-20-the-user-experience-part-1\">Part 1</a> to find out how I installed Fedora 20 on a MacBook Air and why I am so interested in trying to duplicate or even surpass the user experience that I previously enjoyed with OS X.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-cloud\">The Cloud</h3>\n<p>Cloud-based mail, calendaring and file synching have really levelled the playing field between the desktop OSes. It doesn’t matter if you are using OS X or Linux if you read your e-mail in a web browser. Cloud-based services are also the foundation of another important aspect of my day-to-day life: my “gadgets ecosystem”. Even though I’m spending most of my time on Fedora 20 now, my phone and tablet still run iOS. As you will see, this strongly influenced the way that I’ve leveraged the cloud in my system setup.</p>\n<p>Here are the services that I needed to put in the cloud:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mail</li>\n<li>Address Book</li>\n<li>Calendar</li>\n<li>To-Do List(s)</li>\n<li>Notes</li>\n<li>Files (read: a small number of files that would be handy to all of my devices)</li>\n<li>Password Management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these were no-brainers, others drove me to try and end up loving some interesting new services…</p>\n<h3 id=\"mail\">Mail</h3>\n<p>People don’t normally think of mail as a cloud service, but for most folks, it is. I could run my own mail server but I like the fact that my e-mail stuff is being handled by someone who’s full time job is e-mail, and that the service is configured for high availability. That said, part of the reason that I use a native mail client rather than just using my mail service’s web client is so that I can also have a local copy of all of the e-mail. This makes for faster searches and I always have those e-mails on hand if the mail service goes offline.</p>\n<p>That all said, mail is pretty much the original cloud service and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol\">IMAP</a> keeps everything in sync for me, so problem solved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"address-book\">Address Book</h3>\n<p>It may seem odd to think of an address book as being separate from a mail service, but in the cloud, they are. If you use Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo mail, or any of the other popular free e-mail services, you never have to worry about this distinction. This is because Fedora and OS X both understand the concept of bundled internet accounts. You tell your computer “I have a Google account” and then your computer asks you which services to use from the bundled list.</p>\n<p>But I don’t use Gmail for mail, and furthermore I actually dislike Google’s approch to putting every last e-mail address and Google Plus profile in my address book without my consent. For a long time I used iCloud’s address book, but that’s a no-go from a Linux system. So, enter <a href=\"https://owncloud.org/\">ownCloud</a>.</p>\n<p>ownCloud could actually be the answer to a few of the questions in this post, but in my setup I use it expressly for my address book. This lives on an <a href=\"https://hub.openshift.com/quickstarts/4-owncloud\">ownCloud server hosted on OpenShift</a>. Advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of the industry-standard CardDAV protocol makes this solution work for my Linux laptop and my mobile iOS devices</li>\n<li>Two-factor authentication for heightened security</li>\n<li>Hosting on OpenShift means that:\n<ul>\n<li>My app is monitored and restarted if necessary</li>\n<li>I can automate backups with the rhc utility</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"calendar\">Calendar</h3>\n<p>I have to grudgingly give a nod to Google on this one. By solving calendaring and then building a social network with built-in event scheduling, they’ve created a siituation where it is hard to use anything else. ownCloud supports calendaring, but scheduling events across different calendaring systems seems very spotty.</p>\n<p>I threw up my hands on this one; too many folks that I need to share my non-work plans with are all on Google, so I have to live with Google for this as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-do-lists\">To-Do Lists</h3>\n<p>Apple’s “Reminders” app adds a lot of value beyond making lists. Probably the strongest feature there is the ability to geotag a task (e.g. Remind about picking up milk when I get to the grocery store). What “Reminders” doesn’t do is enable me to quickly create tasks from the Terminal, which is where I am working most of the time.</p>\n<p>I’ve ended up splitting the difference on this one. If I need to geotag a task, I’ll create it in Reminders app on my iPhone. Otherwise, I have found an awesome task list solution in <a href=\"http://todotxt.com/\">Todo.txt</a>.</p>\n<p>Todo.txt is great for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Available from the command line</li>\n<li>Can be cloud-enabled via <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> integration<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n<li>Data is stored in a plain text file</li>\n<li>Native apps exist for getting at your lists from iOS / Android devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s a blog post idea in my future where I talk more about why plain text file formats are so great, but for now, the takeaway is that todo.txt uses a winning combination of simplicity and optional cloud availability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Finding an alternative to Notes.app can be dirt simple depending on what you want out of the app. At a minimum, you could simply designate a folder in your DropBox for notes and voila, problem solved. This is particularly true in Fedora 20 and OS X, both of which come with automatic file indexing.</p>\n<p>However, I wanted faster navigation between notes and more targeted searching, and that led me to try out <a href=\"https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy\">nvpy</a>. This oddly-named <a href=\"https://www.python.org/-port\">Python</a> of <a href=\"http://notational.net/\">Notational Velocity</a> makes use of global hotkeys and a very complete set of app-wise key combinations to provide a note-keeping and note-searching powerhouse. It can sync with <a href=\"http://simplenote.com/\">SimpleNote</a>’s API but it also does perfectly well writing Notes to text files, which brings us back into DropBox territory.</p>\n<p><code>nvpy</code> also runs on OS X, but <a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvALT</a> looks a little slicker on OS X and can handle the same DropBox-synced note files as <code>nvpy</code>. There is one difference: <code>nvALT</code> will allow you to create notes with whitespace in the titles while <code>nvpy</code> will not, so get into the habit of putting underscores in the first line of the note.</p>\n<p>The main benefit to this approach is that I can still get at those same notes from iOS. <a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2FUS%2Fapp%2Fid382752422%3Fmt%3D8&amp;t=ZjI5ZDJhOTkzOGUyYjE4MGUzZWM1YWVmYjJlYzEzOTk2NTgzMzZjOSxaV3FDd05GWA%3D%3D\">Elements for DropBox</a> is a Markdown-friendly notes app that has no trouble displaying the notes that I create in nvpy.</p>\n<p>As an aside, ownCloud has a plugin for Notes, but the only way to see / use the notes is through the web UI or the native ownCloud apps. If I <em>really</em> wanted to solve this I’d go with the “just use text files” solution, but we get access from Fedora, OS X, and iOS with DropBox.</p>\n<h3 id=\"files\">Files</h3>\n<p>By now I think you can guess which direction I took. With DropBox and ownCloud to choose from, I’ve gone with DropBox simply because so many more apps can get at those files. If I had very sensitive data to store, I could use ownCloud at the cost of less ease of access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"password-management\">Password Management</h3>\n<p>On OS X I am huge fan of <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a>. However, that’s not going to help me on Fedora. The best solution that I could find was <a href=\"https://lastpass.com/\">LastPass</a>, which runs as a browser plugin under OS X, Linux, and anything else that can run modern builds of FireFox, Chrome or Safari.</p>\n<p>LastPass is free for basic services, but if you want a native mobile app, you need to subscribe. My cheapskate workaround is simply to log into LastPass with my account and manually copy passwords when I need to use them on iOS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-tldr-on-cloud-services\">The TL;DR on Cloud Services</h3>\n<p>Cloud services offer a great way to level the playing field between Fedora 20 and OS X. By shifting my cloud usage to apps that could leverage DropBox or presented well-know web services APIs, I was able to create a setup that makes Fedora 20 work as well as OS X and still be able to get at the same data from my iOS-based mobile devices.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",

As you will see, this strongly influenced the way that I’ve leveraged the cloud in my system setup.\n\nHere are the services that I needed to put in the cloud:\n\n  * Mail\n  * Address Book\n  * Calendar\n  * To-Do List(s)\n  * Notes\n  * Files (read: a small number of files that would be handy to all of my devices)\n  * Password Management\n\nSome of these were no-brainers, others drove me to try and end up loving some interesting new services…\n\n### Mail\n\nPeople don’t normally think of mail as a cloud service, but for most folks, it is. I could run my own mail server but I like the fact that my e-mail stuff is being handled by someone who’s full time job is e-mail, and that the service is configured for high availability. That said, part of the reason that I use a native mail client rather than just using my mail service’s web client is so that I can also have a local copy of all of the e-mail. This makes for faster searches and I always have those e-mails on hand if the mail service goes offline.\n\nThat all said, mail is pretty much the original cloud service and [IMAP][2] keeps everything in sync for me, so problem solved.\n\n### Address Book\n\nIt may seem odd to think of an address book as being separate from a mail service, but in the cloud, they are. If you use Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo mail, or any of the other popular free e-mail services, you never have to worry about this distinction. This is because Fedora and OS X both understand the concept of bundled internet accounts. You tell your computer “I have a Google account” and then your computer asks you which services to use from the bundled list.\n\nBut I don’t use Gmail for mail, and furthermore I actually dislike Google’s approch to putting every last e-mail address and Google Plus profile in my address book without my consent. For a long time I used iCloud’s address book, but that’s a no-go from a Linux system. So, enter [ownCloud][3].\n\nownCloud could actually be the answer to a few of the questions in this post, but in my setup I use it expressly for my address book. This lives on an [ownCloud server hosted on OpenShift][4]. Advantages:\n\n  * Use of the industry-standard CardDAV protocol makes this solution work for my Linux laptop and my mobile iOS devices\n  * Two-factor authentication for heightened security\n  * Hosting on OpenShift means that: \n      * My app is monitored and restarted if necessary\n      * I can automate backups with the rhc utility\n\n### Calendar\n\nI have to grudgingly give a nod to Google on this one. By solving calendaring and then building a social network with built-in event scheduling, they’ve created a siituation where it is hard to use anything else. ownCloud supports calendaring, but scheduling events across different calendaring systems seems very spotty.\n\nI threw up my hands on this one; too many folks that I need to share my non-work plans with are all on Google, so I have to live with Google for this as well.\n\n### To-Do Lists\n\nApple’s “Reminders” app adds a lot of value beyond making lists. Probably the strongest feature there is the ability to geotag a task (e.g. Remind about picking up milk when I get to the grocery store). What “Reminders” doesn’t do is enable me to quickly create tasks from the Terminal, which is where I am working most of the time.\n\nI’ve ended up splitting the difference on this one. If I need to geotag a task, I’ll create it in Reminders app on my iPhone. Otherwise, I have found an awesome task list solution in [Todo.txt][5].\n\nTodo.txt is great for a few reasons:\n\n  * Available from the command line\n  * Can be cloud-enabled via [Dropbox][6] integration<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>\n  * Data is stored in a plain text file\n  * Native apps exist for getting at your lists from iOS / Android devices\n\nThere’s a blog post idea in my future where I talk more about why plain text file formats are so great, but for now, the takeaway is that todo.txt uses a winning combination of simplicity and optional cloud availability.\n\n### Notes\n\nFinding an alternative to Notes.app can be dirt simple depending on what you want out of the app. At a minimum, you could simply designate a folder in your DropBox for notes and voila, problem solved. This is particularly true in Fedora 20 and OS X, both of which come with automatic file indexing.\n\nHowever, I wanted faster navigation between notes and more targeted searching, and that led me to try out [nvpy][7]. This oddly-named [Python][8] of [Notational Velocity][9] makes use of global hotkeys and a very complete set of app-wise key combinations to provide a note-keeping and note-searching powerhouse. It can sync with [SimpleNote][10]’s API but it also does perfectly well writing Notes to text files, which brings us back into DropBox territory.\n\n`nvpy` also runs on OS X, but [nvALT][11] looks a little slicker on OS X and can handle the same DropBox-synced note files as `nvpy`. There is one difference: `nvALT` will allow you to create notes with whitespace in the titles while `nvpy` will not, so get into the habit of putting underscores in the first line of the note.\n\nThe main benefit to this approach is that I can still get at those same notes from iOS. [Elements for DropBox][12] is a Markdown-friendly notes app that has no trouble displaying the notes that I create in nvpy.\n\nAs an aside, ownCloud has a plugin for Notes, but the only way to see / use the notes is through the web UI or the native ownCloud apps. If I _really_ wanted to solve this I’d go with the “just use text files” solution, but we get access from Fedora, OS X, and iOS with DropBox.\n\n### Files\n\nBy now I think you can guess which direction I took. With DropBox and ownCloud to choose from, I’ve gone with DropBox simply because so many more apps can get at those files. If I had very sensitive data to store, I could use ownCloud at the cost of less ease of access.\n\n### Password Management\n\nOn OS X I am huge fan of [1Password][13]. However, that’s not going to help me on Fedora. The best solution that I could find was [LastPass][14], which runs as a browser plugin under OS X, Linux, and anything else that can run modern builds of FireFox, Chrome or Safari.\n\nLastPass is free for basic services, but if you want a native mobile app, you need to subscribe. My cheapskate workaround is simply to log into LastPass with my account and manually copy passwords when I need to use them on iOS.\n\n### The TL;DR on Cloud Services\n\nCloud services offer a great way to level the playing field between Fedora 20 and OS X. By shifting my cloud usage to apps that could leverage DropBox or presented well-know web services APIs, I was able to create a setup that makes Fedora 20 work as well as OS X and still be able to get at the same data from my iOS-based mobile devices.\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <hr />\n  \n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>\n        DropBox shows up a lot in this article. The main reason is that DropBox offers ubiquitous file storage with widely adopted support. Many iOS apps continue to offer DropBox-based syncing as an alternative to iCloud, and DropBox runs on Linux systems as well. This has inadvertantly placed DropBox as the best low-level cloud storage option for a wide variety of uses. <a href=\"1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩︎</a>\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n\n [1]: https://write.as/harrisonripps/os-x-to-fedora-20-the-user-experience-part-1\n [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol\n [3]: https://owncloud.org/\n [4]: https://hub.openshift.com/quickstarts/4-owncloud\n [5]: http://todotxt.com/\n [6]: https://www.dropbox.com/\n [7]: https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy\n [8]: https://www.python.org/-port\n [9]: http://notational.net/\n [10]: http://simplenote.com/\n [11]: http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\n [12]: http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2FUS%2Fapp%2Fid382752422%3Fmt%3D8&t=ZjI5ZDJhOTkzOGUyYjE4MGUzZWM1YWVmYjJlYzEzOTk2NTgzMzZjOSxaV3FDd05GWA%3D%3D\n [13]: https://agilebits.com/onepassword\n [14]: https://lastpass.com/\n",

The man was frozen and still, eyes to the heavens, alabaster white skin except for the now blackened right thigh that had been torn in the car accident–two days ago now? Three? Jeans and sneakers, no shirt. He lay in the lap of the woman, held in a loose embrace.</p>\n<p>Her body rested easily against the trunk of the giant tree. Her frozen black hair framed a face that was at once serene and broken. Jeans and sneakers, tank top. The orbit of bone around her left eye and the eye itself had been crushed when her head hit the dashboard, but her clear, gray right eye stared through Bastion, defiant, beyond him into some other space. There was no fear here, no sadness and no sound except for the drone of the radio some ways behind.</p>\n<p>Bastion remembered his training. “Cold weather is a funny thing. Can’t trust a frozen body. You ain’t dead until youre warm and dead, ya catch me?” He stepped forward gingerly to take pulses on their necks and feel for breathing. He was glancing back into their eyes, looking for signs of something that wasn’t there. Satisfied, Bastions muscles were poised to turn to leave, but his mind held him in check.</p>\n<p>The visions would be with him again when he finally turned away; he wasn’t ready for that yet. So he lingered for another moment, carefully backing away from what had become a crime scene but glancing around long enough to note the wristbands on their pale wrists. Long enough to register the tattoos on their bare arms. And it all slotted into place–the last part of a story that started four days ago with a missing car. The first part, really.</p>\n<p>He felt stupid for the tears that were pricking his eyes. Come on Bastion. They arent sad about it. Got more than most of those poor bastards ever got. Most, but not all… Composing himself, he nodded to them, turned and made the trek back to the others. “Why did they run, Bastion?” It had been a few minutes since he had rejoined them, but Bastions face still glistened with the cold sweat, and he was lost in a private terror for a moment before he could answer. Finally, he pushed the images aside and glanced up. They were patiently waiting, no expression other than that basic curiosity.</p>\n<p>“Why did they run from the crash?” Bastion drew a calming breath that brought him fully back to the present. He nodded down the ridge, wiped his brow, and willed a frozen breath to escape his lips. “They escaped from Anderson Medical Center. The police didn’t tell us that–they probably didn’t know.” The others looked puzzled. Bastion knew they didn’t get it. It didn’t mean to them what it meant to him. Subconsciously scratching at the tattoo on his own arm through the parka and the wool, he glanced around again. “They wanted to live for a while before they died.</p>\n",

The man was frozen and still, eyes to the heavens, alabaster white skin except for the now blackened right thigh that had been torn in the car accident–two days ago now? Three? Jeans and sneakers, no shirt. He lay in the lap of the woman, held in a loose embrace.\n\nHer body rested easily against the trunk of the giant tree. Her frozen black hair framed a face that was at once serene and broken. Jeans and sneakers, tank top. The orbit of bone around her left eye and the eye itself had been crushed when her head hit the dashboard, but her clear, gray right eye stared through Bastion, defiant, beyond him into some other space. There was no fear here, no sadness and no sound except for the drone of the radio some ways behind.\n\nBastion remembered his training. “Cold weather is a funny thing. Can’t trust a frozen body. You ain’t dead until youre warm and dead, ya catch me?” He stepped forward gingerly to take pulses on their necks and feel for breathing. He was glancing back into their eyes, looking for signs of something that wasn’t there. Satisfied, Bastions muscles were poised to turn to leave, but his mind held him in check.\n\nThe visions would be with him again when he finally turned away; he wasn’t ready for that yet. So he lingered for another moment, carefully backing away from what had become a crime scene but glancing around long enough to note the wristbands on their pale wrists. Long enough to register the tattoos on their bare arms. And it all slotted into place–the last part of a story that started four days ago with a missing car. The first part, really.\n\nHe felt stupid for the tears that were pricking his eyes. Come on Bastion. They arent sad about it. Got more than most of those poor bastards ever got. Most, but not all… Composing himself, he nodded to them, turned and made the trek back to the others. “Why did they run, Bastion?” It had been a few minutes since he had rejoined them, but Bastions face still glistened with the cold sweat, and he was lost in a private terror for a moment before he could answer. Finally, he pushed the images aside and glanced up. They were patiently waiting, no expression other than that basic curiosity.\n\n“Why did they run from the crash?” Bastion drew a calming breath that brought him fully back to the present. He nodded down the ridge, wiped his brow, and willed a frozen breath to escape his lips. “They escaped from Anderson Medical Center. The police didn’t tell us that–they probably didn’t know.” The others looked puzzled. Bastion knew they didn’t get it. It didn’t mean to them what it meant to him. Subconsciously scratching at the tattoo on his own arm through the parka and the wool, he glanced around again. “They wanted to live for a while before they died.\n",

				"title": "Why yes, this -is- the right week to tear out all the plumbing...",
				"content_html": "<p>Thursday morning we discovered serious water damage in our living room ceiling, directly below the upstairs bathroom. Annika called the insurance company and they had their emergency response crew out to assess the damage around 5 on the same day. They did an exploratory look around the damage area and brought in some serious dehumidifiers to dry out the wet portions of the house. The response crew then told us to get a plumber in, and the plumbing crew gave us the lowdown: All of the old, cast-iron plumbing between the fixtures in our upstairs bathroom out to the road has to go. The source of the leak was the soil stack itself, which has a half-inch hole rusted through it.</p>\n<p>So, a week to the day before we were going to be hosting Thanksgiving Dinner for eight, we discover that we need to live in a hotel until they can gut out and replace 95% of the domestic service pipes in the house. This is the point where I start wondering things like, &ldquo;gee, I wonder if we&rsquo;ll actually break even when we sell this nightmare&rdquo;. The de-leading fiasco of &lsquo;04 was far more extensive (and expensive), but at least there we could point to the lead-free certificates and tell prospective home buyers that their children wouldn&rsquo;t get lead poisoning in this house. One cannot, however, point to the bathroom and say &ldquo;as an added bonus, we&rsquo;re selling you a <em>working toilet</em>!&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Annika is much more optimistic about the place than I am. Sure, it is a lovely house. And, as she points out, things like water leaks can happen in any home. But other people don&rsquo;t seem to have to structurally reinforce their basements and attics, rewire their electricals, gut and rebuild their kitchens, scrub the lead out of all available surfaces, and tear out all of their old plumbing. I mean, to me it feels like a little much.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we are staying at a nearby Marriott Residence Inn which has been fantastic. Seriously, any time we need to stay at a hotel with the kids, we will try to stay at one of these.

				"content_text": "Thursday morning we discovered serious water damage in our living room ceiling, directly below the upstairs bathroom. Annika called the insurance company and they had their emergency response crew out to assess the damage around 5 on the same day. They did an exploratory look around the damage area and brought in some serious dehumidifiers to dry out the wet portions of the house. The response crew then told us to get a plumber in, and the plumbing crew gave us the lowdown: All of the old, cast-iron plumbing between the fixtures in our upstairs bathroom out to the road has to go. The source of the leak was the soil stack itself, which has a half-inch hole rusted through it.\n<!--more-->\nSo, a week to the day before we were going to be hosting Thanksgiving Dinner for eight, we discover that we need to live in a hotel until they can gut out and replace 95% of the domestic service pipes in the house. This is the point where I start wondering things like, \"gee, I wonder if we'll actually break even when we sell this nightmare\". The de-leading fiasco of '04 was far more extensive (and expensive), but at least there we could point to the lead-free certificates and tell prospective home buyers that their children wouldn't get lead poisoning in this house. One cannot, however, point to the bathroom and say \"as an added bonus, we're selling you a _working toilet_!\".\n\nAnnika is much more optimistic about the place than I am. Sure, it is a lovely house. And, as she points out, things like water leaks can happen in any home. But other people don't seem to have to structurally reinforce their basements and attics, rewire their electricals, gut and rebuild their kitchens, scrub the lead out of all available surfaces, and tear out all of their old plumbing. I mean, to me it feels like a little much. \n\nMeanwhile, we are staying at a nearby Marriott Residence Inn which has been fantastic. Seriously, any time we need to stay at a hotel with the kids, we will try to stay at one of these. The suite is small but thoughtfully laid out; there are two separate bedrooms, a tiny but serviceable kitchen, and a complimentary breakfast is served in the main building. The plumbers feel that they can have us up and running with new pipes by EOB on Wednesday. That means we can be back in our house for Thanksgiving though, for the sake of sanity, we may be postponing the feast by a day.\n",

I&rsquo;ve unofficially DJed a few parties, but never something as involved (and DJ-dependant) as a life-changing ceremony followed by several hours of dancing. Annika will tell you that I spent a lot of the preceeding week in a heightened state of, well, being nervous as hell.</p>\n<p>Before I go much further, let me say that the DJing went well. The ceremony went smoothly, no worries with the random playlist through cocktail hour, and once we got into the post-dinner dancing portion of the evening, I really started to have a lot of fun. The bride and groom seemed happy, no one threatened me. Some of the other wedding guests, themselves veterans of many a sound check, helped me move audio equipment around as events dictated.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not really what Im writing about, though. I was ready for all of that stuff&ndash;I&rsquo;d practiced aspects of the whole set, I knew the (few) tricky sound cues. But what I didn&rsquo;t realize during all of my preparations was that I was building a mental model of what people would want to dance to that was subtly incorrect. I had brought enough of the &ldquo;right&rdquo; kind of music to cover my mistake, but the more I reflect on the whole thing, the more I believe that I was being shown a basic truth about the way we become older.</p>\n<p>Consider, for a minute, Rob Base&rsquo;s seminal work &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;re under thirty and you&rsquo;re not familiar with this track, then think about Fergie&rsquo;s &ldquo;London Bridge&rdquo; and imagine that it is still popular in 2024. Why 2024? Because that&rsquo;s when &ldquo;London Bridge&rdquo; will be a song that is 18 years old, just like &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo; is right now. Let me say that again for those of you who are still thinking about Rob Base: &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo; was released in 1988. If you were on the dance floor last Saturday night at the wedding I DJed, then you probably first danced to &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo; at a high school prom. Or maybe you heard it coming out of the speakers of someone&rsquo;s boom box.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason, the song stuck with you. The repetitive scream that is part of the underlying breakbeat is no longer edgy and urban. Now it&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s funky. You can dance to it. And you know, I love a fun old dance tune as much as the next wedding guest. But I had assumed that everyone&rsquo;s tastes had followed an evolutionary line that also included fun <em>new</em> dance tunes as well as some of the other less mainstream style-descendants of Rob Base, Ini Kamoze (the Hotstepper), and Sir Mix-a-Lot.</p>\n<p>Not so, dear reader. I don&rsquo;t think the human brain works like that. People go to <em>clubs</em> to hear the hot new tracks, not weddings. Weddings are those times when the fondest old memories get fished out of the bin and strung together into newer fond old memories. You can add a wrinkle here or there, but you&rsquo;ll never mix BTs &ldquo;Circles&rdquo; into a party based on the likes of &ldquo;Groove is in the Heart&rdquo; (16 years old), &ldquo;O.P.P.&rdquo; (15 years old), and &ldquo;Push It&rdquo; (20 years old). Now, in everyone&rsquo;s defense, yes, newer songs were played and danced to with vigor. But the set wouldn&rsquo;t have been right without the older songs. There&rsquo;s something about them that adds context to the event. It says: &ldquo;this is the fun for <em>us</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I know it wasnt the fun for the under-ten set at the wedding because I was repeatedly asked by some of the kids when I was going to play &ldquo;something cool&rdquo;. I shudder to think of what&rsquo;s cool music to a ten year old boy. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was in full-on Weird Al worship at ten, and that&rsquo;s just not a good avenue for a wedding DJ to follow.</p>\n<p>This gets a little philosophical when you step back and think about how much of what you do can be fixed to a particular not-necessarily-recent point in time. All of the stupid ad jingles you&rsquo;ve learned. All of the clothing trends that you can recall (though of course, <em>you</em> never dressed that way). Something finds its way into your brain and it stays there. Random happenstance occasionally pulls it up and suddenly on the dance floor youre letting out a primal yell because &ldquo;Rock Lobster&rdquo; (27 years old) is, like, totally your favorite song. (The system works. Writing &ldquo;like, totally&rdquo; got me thinking about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Girl\">Valley Girls</a>.)</p>\n<p>Right now, we&rsquo;ve still got some choices&ndash;we can see that divide between Now and Then. But it gets a lot harder after your brain gets added to the &ldquo;untrustworthy body parts&rdquo; list. One of Annika&rsquo;s grandfathers has repeatedly told me of a particular war-era adventure of his; he forgets that I know the story well. And whenever he tells me the story, I think about the fact that this particular adventure must have contained some of the greatest moments of his life, because he can&rsquo;t always remember the names and faces of his family, but that story lives on the tip of his tongue. To me the real kicker is that he&rsquo;s telling this to his second generation of offspring, and godwilling he&rsquo;ll tell it to the third as well. How could his adventures be any more amazing that seeing a room filled with generations of people who can trace themselves back to <em>him</em>? What does the past possess that is so much more valuable than <em>right now</em>?</p>\n<p>Happily, for the bride and groom at most modern, mutually-embarked-upon weddings, there is nothing but the Now. There&rsquo;s so much Now for them that there isn&rsquo;t room for anything else. If you do anything approaching a traditional wedding and reception these days, your wedding day is the longest Now you&rsquo;ll ever have. But for everyone else, the Now is a little more lovely with a side order of Then.</p>\n<p>I felt a little bad for the wedding guest who got really excited when I mixed in Steve Miller band. It was during a lull before the die hard hip-hop dance crowd layed seige to the dance floor. But in forty years, when Steve Miller and 50 Cent end up on the same &ldquo;Greatest Hits of the Late 1900s&rdquo; compilation, we&rsquo;ll all be there doing the robot while the current hip generation shakes its head in pity. We&rsquo;ll have a choice then, too, of course. We&rsquo;ll choose between hobbling off the dance floor to reflect on how much more awesome our music was and staying on to catch a few measures of what the hip ones are listening to. And if the DJ takes that opportunity to pull out &ldquo;Love Shack&rdquo;&hellip; well, that&rsquo;ll be okay, too :-)</p>\n",

You can add a wrinkle here or there, but you'll never mix BTs \"Circles\" into a party based on the likes of \"Groove is in the Heart\" (16 years old), \"O.P.P.\" (15 years old), and \"Push It\" (20 years old). Now, in everyone's defense, yes, newer songs were played and danced to with vigor. But the set wouldn't have been right without the older songs. There's something about them that adds context to the event. It says: \"this is the fun for _us_\".\n\nI know it wasnt the fun for the under-ten set at the wedding because I was repeatedly asked by some of the kids when I was going to play \"something cool\". I shudder to think of what's cool music to a ten year old boy. I'm pretty sure I was in full-on Weird Al worship at ten, and that's just not a good avenue for a wedding DJ to follow.\n\nThis gets a little philosophical when you step back and think about how much of what you do can be fixed to a particular not-necessarily-recent point in time. All of the stupid ad jingles you've learned. All of the clothing trends that you can recall (though of course, _you_ never dressed that way). Something finds its way into your brain and it stays there. Random happenstance occasionally pulls it up and suddenly on the dance floor youre letting out a primal yell because \"Rock Lobster\" (27 years old) is, like, totally your favorite song. (The system works. Writing \"like, totally\" got me thinking about [Valley Girls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Girl).)\n\nRight now, we've still got some choices--we can see that divide between Now and Then. But it gets a lot harder after your brain gets added to the \"untrustworthy body parts\" list. One of Annika's grandfathers has repeatedly told me of a particular war-era adventure of his; he forgets that I know the story well. And whenever he tells me the story, I think about the fact that this particular adventure must have contained some of the greatest moments of his life, because he can't always remember the names and faces of his family, but that story lives on the tip of his tongue. To me the real kicker is that he's telling this to his second generation of offspring, and godwilling he'll tell it to the third as well. How could his adventures be any more amazing that seeing a room filled with generations of people who can trace themselves back to _him_? What does the past possess that is so much more valuable than _right now_?\n\nHappily, for the bride and groom at most modern, mutually-embarked-upon weddings, there is nothing but the Now. There's so much Now for them that there isn't room for anything else. If you do anything approaching a traditional wedding and reception these days, your wedding day is the longest Now you'll ever have. But for everyone else, the Now is a little more lovely with a side order of Then.\n\nI felt a little bad for the wedding guest who got really excited when I mixed in Steve Miller band. It was during a lull before the die hard hip-hop dance crowd layed seige to the dance floor. But in forty years, when Steve Miller and 50 Cent end up on the same \"Greatest Hits of the Late 1900s\" compilation, we'll all be there doing the robot while the current hip generation shakes its head in pity. We'll have a choice then, too, of course. We'll choose between hobbling off the dance floor to reflect on how much more awesome our music was and staying on to catch a few measures of what the hip ones are listening to. And if the DJ takes that opportunity to pull out \"Love Shack\"... well, that'll be okay, too :-)\n",
