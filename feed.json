				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out recently how to make social media work better for me. I am stuck between two &ldquo;worlds&rdquo;. On the one hand, I&rsquo;ve got my IRL friends and family who are on the major platforms and don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with something different. On the other hand I&rsquo;ve got the professional and hobby-related communities that share my ideologies around social networking, and that have almost entirely abandoned the major platforms for decentralized, user-controlled ones.</p>\n<p>On a different axis of this investigation, I&rsquo;ve noticed that regardless of platform, my mental wellbeing is supported by simple, one-experience user interfaces. Example: Instagram offers both Stories and Reels / Posts in the same interface. This completely kills the flow for me. Stories are useful in that they highlight content that might otherwise disappear from your feed, but they are also incredibly time consuming to get through, even if you are furiously tapping the &ldquo;next story&rdquo; side of the screen.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Mastodon interface offers an &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; view that is reminiscent of TweetDeck and feels like having the Matrix poured into your eyeballs. Even with &ldquo;slow mode&rdquo; enabled, it is not a relaxed scroll through the fediverse. So in both cases, I have dumbed down the interfaces as much as possible. I mute Stories for every account that I follow on IG, and I gladly stick with Mastodon&rsquo;s basic interface.</p>\n<p>Because my groups of interest inhabit different platforms, but the conversations that I want to start are the same across those groups, I&rsquo;m going to settle for cross-posting. And I can say, objectively, that Mastodon supports this perfectly out of the box, while IG, thanks to Meta, only supports this in the douchiest way possible. It&rsquo;s a rant for another day, but if you want to post to your IG account from a 3rd-party cross-posting tool, you <em>must</em>: a) have an FB account, b) have an FB page that links to your IG account, and c) your IG account must be a Creator or Business account.</p>\n<p>So here&rsquo;s where I have to be totally honest with my IRL friends and family: If it weren&rsquo;t for you, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother with IG, FB, or any other centralized platform <em>at all</em>.

It was a relatively rare situation of us wrapping up a full start-to-finish campaign, and it was particularly notable for two reasons. First off, it is the last campaign that I will ever run in the bespoke game setting that I started building over 20 years ago.

I&rsquo;m taking an extended leave from running table-top RPGs and significantly limiting my participation in table-top RPGs until Autumn.</p>\n<p>The bespoke setting. If you ever played a campaign in the setting that I cooked up, you&rsquo;d recognize particular NPC names that appeared again and again. Time within the setting marched on between each adventure, and by the time of the most recent campaign, all but a few of those NPCs had passed away. That&rsquo;s been one of the most interesting aspects of the setting for me - thinking about the legacies of people and events gone by; legacies that span hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of years.</p>\n<p>But working within the framework of any story setting has inherent limitations. If I ever run another tabletop RPG, I want to start fresh. Tell a new story. So with gratitude I surrender Ymir, Idvalexi, Brother Helix, Black Molly Kithkani, Captain Braddock, the Lightwing, and all of Serkemir and the Five Realms to the void. Zola Shadowland, last of the Hell&rsquo;s Footmen, has a reprieve until the end of the campaign where I play her as a PC - her origin story. Then she will join the others in the mists.</p>\n<p>The extended hiatus. With the exception of the <em>very infrequent</em> campaign in which Zola Shadowland abides, I am taking a break from table-top RPGs completely. This decision has been driven by two main factors. The lesser factor is Zoom fatigue. I spend a lot of my working hours on Zoom, and weekly evening Zoom sessions were very difficult for me.

But what remained to be done was the raw creative work of telling a story, and that energy comes from the same place that all of my writing comes from.

Thursday nights are apparently a big night for the local electronic music scene in Boston, and I want to see what kind of connections I can make there.

Thursday nights are apparently a big night for the local electronic music scene in Boston, and I want to see what kind of connections I can make there. Even though writing and DJing don't require the same sort of energy from me, taking an extended break from my deeply established D&D hobby gives me more time and creative energy for both of those other pursuits. I'm not expecting to become an overnight success in either, but I am excited to see what I can do with the opportunity.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When I was a kid, I had some dreams that were so vivid that the sensory experience of them was almost indistinguishable from being awake.

				"content_html": "<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin with this month. I have strong emotional reactions to just thinking about it, but why bother trying to capture all of that negativity. I won&rsquo;t appreciate reading it later - if I ever bring myself to reading this particular article later. So I&rsquo;ll just try to capture things in chronological order and leave the rest for future me to work out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"november-27-december-3rd\">November 27-December 3rd</h2>\n<p>This month really started on November 27th, <a href=\"https://nharrisonripps.com/goodbye-dad\">the day my father died</a>. The days that immediately followed were split between my day job and the list of things that you need to do to announce a death and plan a funeral. We set the date of the service to be December 16th. I immediately booked an AirBnB for the weekend of the service so that we&rsquo;d be available to my stepmother.</p>\n<p>Rather randomly, my left foot started to hurt on November 28th, blooming into burning pain through that night into the next day. I went to urgent care and we determined that it wasn&rsquo;t broken and it <em>probably</em> wasn&rsquo;t gout. I finally made an appointment with my PCP on Thursday because my foot had swollen to the point where I could barely put a shoe on it. I started a five day course of steroids and a ten day course of antibiotics that I would be dealing with through Sunday, the 11th. I have a podiatry appointment coming up in January - still no idea what triggered this whole thing.</p>\n<p>My company offers an extremely generous bereavement leave, and the absolute smartest thing I did in that first week was to opt to take the full offered leave of two weeks, starting the following Monday. It effectively meant that I would be taking all of December off. At that point, I was thinking that there would be so much free time for me to just process what my dad&rsquo;s death meant in terms of my own life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"december-4-10\">December 4-10</h2>\n<p>Despite the scramble to get work buttoned up between November 28th and December 2nd, I still had a few work items to address during the first week of bereavement leave. I also needed to spend two days in CT, helping my stepmother to begin going through my father&rsquo;s things, and walking through <em>all</em> of my father&rsquo;s online accounts to delete them or at least remove any credit card information.</p>\n<p>I also tried - for the second and third times - to get snow tires put on my car. Neither trip would be successful due to a miscommunication between the service department and the parts department at the local shop. These departments are literally ten feet from each other.</p>\n<p>To help my stepmother, I also set up all of the cookies-and-fruit-trays catering for the funeral service plus a large catered dinner at a restaurant after the service. My stepmother then canceled the post-service catering and booked her own. Whatever, it&rsquo;s only time, right?</p>\n<p>That weekend was devoted to getting the boys ready both for their ski season and for the funeral. Miraculously, the suits that I bought them for a family engagement over the summer still fit well enough for them to wear to the service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"december-11-17\">December 11-17</h2>\n<p>On Sunday, emboldened by my left foot&rsquo;s recovery from the random swelling situation, I went for my first run since the day that my father died. Easy does it, and it seemed good!</p>\n<p>On Monday I finally managed to get snow tires on the car. The rest of the day was largely devoted to house work - the stuff that you do in a normal week that I hadn&rsquo;t been able to attend to since before Thanksgiving. Plus grocery shopping.</p>\n<p>Tuesday and Wednesday - more funeral prep. Haircuts for me and the boys. Plus a completely ridiculous side plot involving a tradition of matching PJs for Christmas morning (not the ridiculous part), colliding with my mother&rsquo;s unfathomably complicated mental gymnastics when it comes to absolutely <em>everything</em>. She almost killed Christmas, but boy was she going to outdo herself in that department later on.</p>\n<p>Thursday morning I got in my third run of the week and everything seemed cool until the afternoon, when the same kind of minor pain that preceded my major inflammatory problem started to creep up. I called my PCP in a panic to at least get me set up for more steroid if I needed it. By the time we got it all together, I needed to have the prescription sent to a pharmacy in CT so I could pick it up on the way down.</p>\n<p>Thursday evening I brought the boys down to CT to be with their cousins before the funeral. My sister and I synced up with my stepmother. We talked about how to divide and conquer tasks for the following day. Meanwhile, my wife headed to my daughter&rsquo;s college - 2.5 hours in a different direction - to bring her straight to the service the next day.</p>\n<p>Friday was the funeral service. Highlights: first off, some of my friends made the long trip and I am grateful for them. Also, four people spoke about my dad (myself included), and the other three eulogies were first-rate. I&rsquo;ll leave others to rate my own delivery. I will note that my father actually wrote most of the eulogy that I delivered; it was the retirement speech that he never got to give. He always needed to have the last word when talking with me, so I felt obliged to let him have it one last time.</p>\n<p>The catered restaurant dinner after the funeral was a high point. The event coordinator at the restaurant was great to work with. Even when our anticipated guest list of 30 turned out to be only 16, they adapted the plan with no fuss. The food was also great.</p>\n<p>Saturday was largely spent in my dad&rsquo;s basement, going through fishing gear with my sister and a close friend and fishing buddy of my father. But there was also a massive near-disaster. That morning at the AirBnB, I was carrying laundry down the narrow staircase of this ancient farmhouse, and I slipped. I fell down half the flight of stairs and landed hard on my right hip. The iPhone that was in my back pocket was utterly destroyed, and as I write this article ten days afterwards, the massive black bruise that I got from that fall has spread from my hip down to the back of my knee.</p>\n<p>Miraculously, I didn&rsquo;t break my hip. I&rsquo;m not sure if the iPhone&rsquo;s destruction saved my hip or made the injury worse than it would have been otherwise. In any case, I had to add a trip to the Apple Store to the day&rsquo;s activities. Every day since then, the hip has gotten a little better. Between the foot issue and the hip issue, I haven&rsquo;t tried to run. Today I did a 4 mile walk and it feels like a huge win.</p>\n<h2 id=\"december-18-24\">December 18-24</h2>\n<p>Sunday we wrapped up our time in CT with a magic show at a venue I hadn&rsquo;t been to in many years. My stepmother wanted everyone to leave on a high note and so she treated us to this show. I was more excited to see the inside of the venue - a theater where I had seen many of the most memorable movies of my childhood - than the magic show. But I&rsquo;m sure the kids loved it.</p>\n<p>Monday a.m. I drove my daughter and myself to NH to open up the vacation house for Christmas. Monday and Tuesday were blessedly quiet days. I spent them working on my handmade presents for people and binging reality shows. It was glorious. They were really my first opportunity to start decompressing from this crazy month. Wednesday my wife and the boys came up, and the energy levels slowly started ramping up towards all of our Christmas plans.</p>\n<p>Thursday I drove back to MA to collect my mother and drove her back to NH for the holiday. We had made several adaptations to the house to accommodate for my mother&rsquo;s physical limitations - she is still nursing a shoulder replacement that she got back in October. But as is predictably the case, my mother still found things to complain about: temperature of the house, food options, etc.</p>\n<p>By Thursday night the news stations were all covering the upcoming mega storm. It looked like we would be getting it mild compared to the rest of the country - rain, but not snow. The joke was definitely on us.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the day on Friday, things went from mildly stormy to full on emergency. The first issue was the heavy rain. We already had three feet of snow on the ground, so the rain that fell around the house ran through our fieldstone foundation like a sieve. We didn&rsquo;t have significantly deep flooding, but we had a steady stream for hours. My wife and I filled the shop vac with water at least a dozen times as we worked to try and keep the flooding under control.</p>\n<p>The next issue was the wind. The strongest winds were coming across a meadow to the screened in porch side of our house. For the winter time, we had installed large glass panels behind the screens to create a small amount of insulation on the porch. The force of the winds was enough to blow the panels out of their brackets, rendering them useless and also risking to shatter them on the furniture there. I worked with my son to get them laid down on the porch so they would at least not break before the storm was over.</p>\n<p>Finally, when my wife and I were picking up my daughter from her shift at a local hardware store at 6pm, we got a call from my in-laws to let us know that the power had gone out at the house. My wife wisely bought six gallons of water and a flashlight from the hardware store before we headed back to a dark house.</p>\n<p>The rain was all but over, and the flooding in the house was resolving, but a squall line about seventy miles long had taken out power in around 43000 homes in that part of New Hampshire. The power company has a publicly viewable outage map and was providing status updates every twelve hours. I took in all of the data and I sensed that it was going to be a while before power came back.</p>\n<p>This was Friday, the 23rd. We were on the books to host a Christmas Eve party for 30 people the following night. My wife texted the full list of guests to let them know that we were looking forward to their company, but be advised that we would be having our annual Christmas Smorgasbord by candlelight. Props to her crazy viking family, but absolutely all of them were totally on board to proceed with a holiday dinner in a house with no power.</p>\n<p>Friday night into Saturday morning, the house was warm enough that we were all sleeping in our regular beds. When any of us woke up during the night, we would head to the fireplaces and throw another log on. I have a small thermometer in each of the two bathrooms and by the next morning, they were still reading in the high 40s.</p>\n<p>Friday temps were as high as the 50s, but by Saturday night, it was a different story.</p>\n<p>The first dinner party was a success. Between two roaring fireplaces and thirty people packed into the house, we were warm. Thanks to the nature of smorgasbord there were very few dishes that needed to be served hot, and my in-laws had power at their house to do the heating. So we were also well-fed.</p>\n<p>By the time our guests left, however, temperatures had dropped significantly, and the reality of our situation came into focus. Earlier in the day, I had asked my mother if she would be more comfortable in a hotel room on Christmas Eve. I knew it was going to be cold in the house and so I had investigated room availability in nearby towns. Amazingly, she declined. To my mother&rsquo;s credit, she was going to ride out the power outage with us.</p>\n<p>So, we settled in to a long winter&rsquo;s night. It wasn&rsquo;t cozy. We gave up on our second floor rooms, which were already freezing, and settled in around the two fireplaces on the first floor. My wife and I took turns on fire watch the entire night to keep those fireplaces going. I was continuously cold from 8pm on Christmas Eve and throughout the night. The temperatures on those thermometers in the bathrooms kept dipping lower.</p>\n<h2 id=\"december-25---26\">December 25 - 26</h2>\n<p>At 3am on Christmas morning, I awoke with a start. The main fireplace was down to embers, and the secondary fireplace was completely out. I scrambled to get things going again. My fire-tending woke up my wife and my mother. My wife kept an eye on the main fire as I collected my mental faculties to build a fire in the secondary fireplace that would succeed on the first lighting.</p>\n<p>As I knelt in front of this fireplace, blowing on near-dead embers to bring it back to life, I heard feet shuffling behind me. My mom tapped me on the shoulder and said &ldquo;Christmas gifts&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I need to explain that a little. In my mother&rsquo;s family, there is a tradition on Christmas morning. It&rsquo;s a game. The goal of the game is to say the phrase &ldquo;Christmas gifts&rdquo; to the other people in the house before they say it to you. It&rsquo;s like a game of tag. When I became connected to my wife&rsquo;s family, I brought this tradition along with me because it was a special part of the holiday that I enjoyed - even though I was often slow on the draw when it came to getting the words &ldquo;Christmas gifts&rdquo; out.</p>\n<p>This Christmas morning, with temperatures in the house now in the high 30s, with me struggling to light a fire so that we didn&rsquo;t freeze and neither did the plumbing, my mother was&hellip; trying to lighten the mood maybe? Trying to capture a little Christmas spirit? And that was the exact moment where I no longer gave a fuck if it was Christmas. I didn&rsquo;t feel it and I barely had the energy to make any sort of response whatsoever. I got the fire going and went back to the couch for some more fitful sleep.</p>\n<p>At 5am I woke up again. The fires had burned low. The temperature in the bathrooms was 34 degrees Fahrenheit. It wasn&rsquo;t going to get any colder outside, but all I could think about was the next night. How were we going to do this again?</p>\n<p>My in-laws had taken our youngest back to their place on Christmas Eve but they came back on Christmas morning with hot coffee and warm coffee bread. We were all wearing our matching PJs, my mother included, but we were all wearing them under multiple layers of other clothing.</p>\n<p>Conversation about how to manage Christmas Dinner began as we opened presents. With no power, we still had a lot of leftover dishes from the Smorgasbord. Our in-laws had made a dent by bringing some back to their house, but we were still behind. And all of that was secondary to the major logistical challenge: we couldn&rsquo;t host my wife&rsquo;s 98-year-old grandmother in a freezing house with no power.</p>\n<p>My wife wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up on hosting the dinner. Even as other family members seemed to be making the decision on her behalf, she was resolute in waiting to see how the day unfolded. For my own part, I knew only two things: first off - that I had barely enough energy to focus on anything but keeping our house above freezing, and second off - that I would support my wife&rsquo;s wishes even if I didn&rsquo;t think it would be possible to host another dinner in our house.</p>\n<p>At 1:30 in the afternoon, as I prepared to drive over to my in-laws' house for a shower, the power in the house came back on. By 2:30, the heavy momentum of hosting Christmas dinner at an alternate location had been reversed. By 5:00, the house was clean and ready for guests, and the temperature had be restored to a level that would be comfortable for my wife&rsquo;s grandmother.</p>\n<p>All in all, we were 43 hours without power. I have a good relationship with a local electrician, and this spring I&rsquo;ll be investing in a whole-house generator. I never want this kind of emergency to happen again.</p>\n<p>If the Christmas spirit had completely abandoned me in the early hours of the day, our dinner party restored some of it. Despite my profound physical and mental exhaustion, the energy of the party and our guests brought me back to life a little bit.</p>\n<p>I slept like the dead on Christmas night, and woke up in the warmth of my bed on Monday morning. That day I made another round trip to MA to bring my mother home and check on our place before returning to the vacation house in NH.</p>\n<p>When I returned, friends were over to visit for the afternoon, and when they left, it was back to just my immediate family for the first time in several days. Once again, last night, I slept like the dead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"today\">Today</h2>\n<p>It has been exactly thirty days since my dad died. Mourning comes and goes. It hit me most recently when I was getting a load of wood from the barn and I looked up at the canoe that he and I had fished in for years when I was little. My relationship with him was difficult and complex and I&rsquo;ll tackle it in bits and pieces - some other time.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the absurdly stressful and endless string of events that came up, I am mostly struck by two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Undoubtedly, many of the people in the world have it worse than me. In Ukraine, in underdeveloped and corrupt places, in parts of the US that are still without power. I fully expect that if I ever re-read this article, I will be struck by how petty all of this is. I wrote this in the <em>hope</em> that I will chuckle at the pettiness of it some day.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The few moments where I felt truly grounded and at peace were worth their weight in gold. Don&rsquo;t sleep on those quiet moments. They are gifts. Practice awareness so that you don&rsquo;t miss them.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the last days of 2022 have in store for us, so I&rsquo;m just going to be grateful for living through them, and for hopefully finding the grace to make them good for those around me.</p>",

I also needed to spend two days in CT, helping my stepmother to begin going through my father's things, and walking through _all_ of my father's online accounts to delete them or at least remove any credit card information.\n\nI also tried - for the second and third times - to get snow tires put on my car. Neither trip would be successful due to a miscommunication between the service department and the parts department at the local shop. These departments are literally ten feet from each other.\n\nTo help my stepmother, I also set up all of the cookies-and-fruit-trays catering for the funeral service plus a large catered dinner at a restaurant after the service. My stepmother then canceled the post-service catering and booked her own. Whatever, it's only time, right?\n\nThat weekend was devoted to getting the boys ready both for their ski season and for the funeral. Miraculously, the suits that I bought them for a family engagement over the summer still fit well enough for them to wear to the service.\n\n## December 11-17\nOn Sunday, emboldened by my left foot's recovery from the random swelling situation, I went for my first run since the day that my father died. Easy does it, and it seemed good!\n\nOn Monday I finally managed to get snow tires on the car. The rest of the day was largely devoted to house work - the stuff that you do in a normal week that I hadn't been able to attend to since before Thanksgiving. Plus grocery shopping.\n\nTuesday and Wednesday - more funeral prep. Haircuts for me and the boys. Plus a completely ridiculous side plot involving a tradition of matching PJs for Christmas morning (not the ridiculous part), colliding with my mother's unfathomably complicated mental gymnastics when it comes to absolutely _everything_. She almost killed Christmas, but boy was she going to outdo herself in that department later on.\n\nThursday morning I got in my third run of the week and everything seemed cool until the afternoon, when the same kind of minor pain that preceded my major inflammatory problem started to creep up. I called my PCP in a panic to at least get me set up for more steroid if I needed it. By the time we got it all together, I needed to have the prescription sent to a pharmacy in CT so I could pick it up on the way down.\n\nThursday evening I brought the boys down to CT to be with their cousins before the funeral. My sister and I synced up with my stepmother. We talked about how to divide and conquer tasks for the following day. Meanwhile, my wife headed to my daughter's college - 2.5 hours in a different direction - to bring her straight to the service the next day.\n\nFriday was the funeral service. Highlights: first off, some of my friends made the long trip and I am grateful for them. Also, four people spoke about my dad (myself included), and the other three eulogies were first-rate. I'll leave others to rate my own delivery. I will note that my father actually wrote most of the eulogy that I delivered; it was the retirement speech that he never got to give. He always needed to have the last word when talking with me, so I felt obliged to let him have it one last time.\n\nThe catered restaurant dinner after the funeral was a high point. The event coordinator at the restaurant was great to work with. Even when our anticipated guest list of 30 turned out to be only 16, they adapted the plan with no fuss. The food was also great.\n\nSaturday was largely spent in my dad's basement, going through fishing gear with my sister and a close friend and fishing buddy of my father. But there was also a massive near-disaster. That morning at the AirBnB, I was carrying laundry down the narrow staircase of this ancient farmhouse, and I slipped. I fell down half the flight of stairs and landed hard on my right hip. The iPhone that was in my back pocket was utterly destroyed, and as I write this article ten days afterwards, the massive black bruise that I got from that fall has spread from my hip down to the back of my knee.\n\nMiraculously, I didn't break my hip. I'm not sure if the iPhone's destruction saved my hip or made the injury worse than it would have been otherwise. In any case, I had to add a trip to the Apple Store to the day's activities. Every day since then, the hip has gotten a little better. Between the foot issue and the hip issue, I haven't tried to run. Today I did a 4 mile walk and it feels like a huge win.\n\n## December 18-24\nSunday we wrapped up our time in CT with a magic show at a venue I hadn't been to in many years. My stepmother wanted everyone to leave on a high note and so she treated us to this show. I was more excited to see the inside of the venue - a theater where I had seen many of the most memorable movies of my childhood - than the magic show. But I'm sure the kids loved it.\n\nMonday a.m. I drove my daughter and myself to NH to open up the vacation house for Christmas. Monday and Tuesday were blessedly quiet days. I spent them working on my handmade presents for people and binging reality shows. It was glorious. They were really my first opportunity to start decompressing from this crazy month. Wednesday my wife and the boys came up, and the energy levels slowly started ramping up towards all of our Christmas plans.\n\nThursday I drove back to MA to collect my mother and drove her back to NH for the holiday. We had made several adaptations to the house to accommodate for my mother's physical limitations - she is still nursing a shoulder replacement that she got back in October. But as is predictably the case, my mother still found things to complain about: temperature of the house, food options, etc.\n\nBy Thursday night the news stations were all covering the upcoming mega storm. It looked like we would be getting it mild compared to the rest of the country - rain, but not snow. The joke was definitely on us.\n\nOver the course of the day on Friday, things went from mildly stormy to full on emergency. The first issue was the heavy rain. We already had three feet of snow on the ground, so the rain that fell around the house ran through our fieldstone foundation like a sieve. We didn't have significantly deep flooding, but we had a steady stream for hours. My wife and I filled the shop vac with water at least a dozen times as we worked to try and keep the flooding under control.\n\nThe next issue was the wind. The strongest winds were coming across a meadow to the screened in porch side of our house. For the winter time, we had installed large glass panels behind the screens to create a small amount of insulation on the porch. The force of the winds was enough to blow the panels out of their brackets, rendering them useless and also risking to shatter them on the furniture there. I worked with my son to get them laid down on the porch so they would at least not break before the storm was over.\n\nFinally, when my wife and I were picking up my daughter from her shift at a local hardware store at 6pm, we got a call from my in-laws to let us know that the power had gone out at the house. My wife wisely bought six gallons of water and a flashlight from the hardware store before we headed back to a dark house.\n\nThe rain was all but over, and the flooding in the house was resolving, but a squall line about seventy miles long had taken out power in around 43000 homes in that part of New Hampshire. The power company has a publicly viewable outage map and was providing status updates every twelve hours. I took in all of the data and I sensed that it was going to be a while before power came back.\n\nThis was Friday, the 23rd. We were on the books to host a Christmas Eve party for 30 people the following night. My wife texted the full list of guests to let them know that we were looking forward to their company, but be advised that we would be having our annual Christmas Smorgasbord by candlelight. Props to her crazy viking family, but absolutely all of them were totally on board to proceed with a holiday dinner in a house with no power.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, the house was warm enough that we were all sleeping in our regular beds. When any of us woke up during the night, we would head to the fireplaces and throw another log on. I have a small thermometer in each of the two bathrooms and by the next morning, they were still reading in the high 40s.\n\nFriday temps were as high as the 50s, but by Saturday night, it was a different story.\n\nThe first dinner party was a success. Between two roaring fireplaces and thirty people packed into the house, we were warm. Thanks to the nature of smorgasbord there were very few dishes that needed to be served hot, and my in-laws had power at their house to do the heating. So we were also well-fed.\n\nBy the time our guests left, however, temperatures had dropped significantly, and the reality of our situation came into focus. Earlier in the day, I had asked my mother if she would be more comfortable in a hotel room on Christmas Eve. I knew it was going to be cold in the house and so I had investigated room availability in nearby towns. Amazingly, she declined. To my mother's credit, she was going to ride out the power outage with us.\n\nSo, we settled in to a long winter's night. It wasn't cozy. We gave up on our second floor rooms, which were already freezing, and settled in around the two fireplaces on the first floor. My wife and I took turns on fire watch the entire night to keep those fireplaces going. I was continuously cold from 8pm on Christmas Eve and throughout the night. The temperatures on those thermometers in the bathrooms kept dipping lower.\n\n## December 25 - 26\nAt 3am on Christmas morning, I awoke with a start. The main fireplace was down to embers, and the secondary fireplace was completely out. I scrambled to get things going again. My fire-tending woke up my wife and my mother. My wife kept an eye on the main fire as I collected my mental faculties to build a fire in the secondary fireplace that would succeed on the first lighting.\n\nAs I knelt in front of this fireplace, blowing on near-dead embers to bring it back to life, I heard feet shuffling behind me. My mom tapped me on the shoulder and said \"Christmas gifts\".\n\nI need to explain that a little. In my mother's family, there is a tradition on Christmas morning. It's a game. The goal of the game is to say the phrase \"Christmas gifts\" to the other people in the house before they say it to you. It's like a game of tag. When I became connected to my wife's family, I brought this tradition along with me because it was a special part of the holiday that I enjoyed - even though I was often slow on the draw when it came to getting the words \"Christmas gifts\" out.\n\nThis Christmas morning, with temperatures in the house now in the high 30s, with me struggling to light a fire so that we didn't freeze and neither did the plumbing, my mother was... trying to lighten the mood maybe? Trying to capture a little Christmas spirit? And that was the exact moment where I no longer gave a fuck if it was Christmas. I didn't feel it and I barely had the energy to make any sort of response whatsoever. I got the fire going and went back to the couch for some more fitful sleep.\n\nAt 5am I woke up again. The fires had burned low. The temperature in the bathrooms was 34 degrees Fahrenheit. It wasn't going to get any colder outside, but all I could think about was the next night. How were we going to do this again?\n\nMy in-laws had taken our youngest back to their place on Christmas Eve but they came back on Christmas morning with hot coffee and warm coffee bread. We were all wearing our matching PJs, my mother included, but we were all wearing them under multiple layers of other clothing.\n\nConversation about how to manage Christmas Dinner began as we opened presents. With no power, we still had a lot of leftover dishes from the Smorgasbord. Our in-laws had made a dent by bringing some back to their house, but we were still behind. And all of that was secondary to the major logistical challenge: we couldn't host my wife's 98-year-old grandmother in a freezing house with no power.\n\nMy wife wasn't ready to give up on hosting the dinner. Even as other family members seemed to be making the decision on her behalf, she was resolute in waiting to see how the day unfolded. For my own part, I knew only two things: first off - that I had barely enough energy to focus on anything but keeping our house above freezing, and second off - that I would support my wife's wishes even if I didn't think it would be possible to host another dinner in our house.\n\nAt 1:30 in the afternoon, as I prepared to drive over to my in-laws' house for a shower, the power in the house came back on. By 2:30, the heavy momentum of hosting Christmas dinner at an alternate location had been reversed. By 5:00, the house was clean and ready for guests, and the temperature had be restored to a level that would be comfortable for my wife's grandmother.\n\nAll in all, we were 43 hours without power. I have a good relationship with a local electrician, and this spring I'll be investing in a whole-house generator. I never want this kind of emergency to happen again.\n\nIf the Christmas spirit had completely abandoned me in the early hours of the day, our dinner party restored some of it. Despite my profound physical and mental exhaustion, the energy of the party and our guests brought me back to life a little bit.\n\nI slept like the dead on Christmas night, and woke up in the warmth of my bed on Monday morning. That day I made another round trip to MA to bring my mother home and check on our place before returning to the vacation house in NH.\n\nWhen I returned, friends were over to visit for the afternoon, and when they left, it was back to just my immediate family for the first time in several days. Once again, last night, I slept like the dead.\n\n## Today\nIt has been exactly thirty days since my dad died. Mourning comes and goes. It hit me most recently when I was getting a load of wood from the barn and I looked up at the canoe that he and I had fished in for years when I was little. My relationship with him was difficult and complex and I'll tackle it in bits and pieces - some other time.\n\nReflecting on the absurdly stressful and endless string of events that came up, I am mostly struck by two things:\n\n1. Undoubtedly, many of the people in the world have it worse than me. In Ukraine, in underdeveloped and corrupt places, in parts of the US that are still without power. I fully expect that if I ever re-read this article, I will be struck by how petty all of this is. I wrote this in the _hope_ that I will chuckle at the pettiness of it some day.\n\n2. The few moments where I felt truly grounded and at peace were worth their weight in gold. Don't sleep on those quiet moments. They are gifts. Practice awareness so that you don't miss them.\n\nI don't know what the last days of 2022 have in store for us, so I'm just going to be grateful for living through them, and for hopefully finding the grace to make them good for those around me.\n",

Unlike most of the young men and women going through in-processing that day in Boston, I was already a college graduate, I was already married, and I wasn&rsquo;t exactly young. I was twenty-eight years old. Had a full-time job as a software engineer, had a mortgage. What motivated me to join was a sense that I could be doing more to serve others.

In groups of ten we went into a gas-filled bunker wearing gas masks, took them off, and then had to purge and re-wear the masks inside of the tear gas cloud. Tear gas is a respiratory irritant that attacks your mucous membranes. It was like eating hot peppers and then pouring the juice into your nose and eyes. It really reminded me of some of the spiciest foods I&rsquo;d ever eaten, to the extent that when I was finally outside of the bunker, riding the adrenaline rush, I shouted &ldquo;HOT SAUCE, BABY!&rdquo; I have video evidence of that moment. The drill sergeants were grudgingly impressed.</p>\n<p>But I think the biggest lesson of boot camp is that you get to find out what kind of person you are under tremendous stress. I&rsquo;m talking about full physical and mental stress: complete exhaustion, calorie depletion, with people shouting in your face while you attempt to do attention-demanding tasks like disassembling and reassembling rifles, walking security patrols, throwing grenades. And I found out that I was more afraid of making a mistake in front of my drill sergeants than I was of anything else that I was doing there. So of course, several weeks in, my big moment of total physical and mental breakdown was right in front of one of my drill sergeants.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t remember too much about it. Mostly I just remember that I was a terrible athlete growing up and that I was therefore terrible at throwing things.

I was doing a pretty bad job with this. The first failure was no big deal but the third&hellip; and then the fourth&hellip; And when my drill sergeant took me aside for a little pep talk, I just flipped out on him. I was in &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; mode but I had chosen option C: &ldquo;bitter sarchasm&rdquo; with a dash of &ldquo;if you are going to hit me, then just f*ing do it&rdquo;. In their defense, none of my drill sergeants had ever hit me. And this one wouldn&rsquo;t have needed to at that moment, anyway - because if there was some game of wits going on, I had already lost.</p>\n<p>My drill sergeant was a fully frightening human being, but out there on the training grounds he just looked at me and told me to get my sh<em>t together. So, I got my sh</em>t together and went back through the training until I qualified. And later that day, I threw a live grenade over a bunker wall. And that was that. On to the next training module.

The front of our shop had the grill, the sandwich-making stations, deep fryers, warming trays, and cash registers. On a slow day, two people could easily run the front of the shop. During the holiday rush, it took at least six people to keep up the pace - which was about 90 seconds per order during peak serving time.</p>\n<p>On my last Saturday shift of the calendar year, I punched in at 8am to help get the shop ready before the mall opened at 9. The kitchen was already buzzing as I set to work on the front of the house with some of my coworkers. At almost a year into the job, I was considered a long-timer for the front, and by luck that day only one or two of the other folks were totally new. We went through the setup procedures and then sipped our coffees as the mall opened for business. By 9:15 there were at least five hundred shoppers in the mall.

There was a pair of managers for our pair of restaurants, and they had to step into both shops to deal with early equipment problems (our soda fountains went down temporarily, as did one of the fro-yo place&rsquo;s mixers), and later they were back out to break up an argument at the other shop&rsquo;s register. As lunch hour approached, one of the new folks on my team left for a smoke a break and never came back. When it became obvious that we were down a person for the rest of the shift, we barely had time to think about it. As we rolled into peak, between the two stations we were making and selling around twelve sandwiches every three minutes.</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t notice when it happened, but at some point in there, the managers had stepped back into their office in the kitchen, and five of us just did the work of six for the next four hours.

				"content_html": "<p>We lost Mia today. I’ve always read posts like this with some amount of indifference because in the back of my head I am thinking “this is just an animal” and “this is not a person”. And so I forgive you for feeling the same way. I understand that response.</p>\n<p>This stream of thoughts is really for me, and it is also for my wife and kids and anyone else who feels the loss of our “just a cat” as acutely as I am feeling it right now. But maybe you’ve been here, too, with your pets, at the end of a chapter in your own life. Here is a rememberance for us.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mia and her sister Pia came into our lives on March 15th, 2002. I remember this day well because it was the Ides of March and by an ironic coincidence, I spent that day at the enlistment center in Boston, signing up to join the Army National Guard. The cats were originally found in a cardboard box by a dumpster, and their age at the time that they came home to us was estimated to be eight months.</p>\n<p>We had no children yet, we were both working, and I was going to be disappearing for two and a half months to go to basic training. My wife wanted (and still wants) a dog, but I knew our lifestyle couldn’t work with dogs. Mia and Pia were the compromise.</p>\n<p>Despite being part of the same litter, Mia and Pia couldn’t have been less alike. Pia was a long haired cat, mostly gray with dark streaks. Mia was the classic black and white tabby cat. Pia was a normal-sized, aggressive, dominating cat. Mia never grew past the size of a kitten, and spent her youth quietly in her sister’s shadow.</p>\n<p>The cats were raised to be indoor-outdoor cats and spent many a night out and about in our neighborhood. The extent of their range was not obvious to us until, a few years later, Pia had gone missing for a few days. A neighbor, some streets away from us, put up a poster about the dead cat they had found meeting Pia’s description.</p>\n<p>I went to discover that Pia had been hit by a car and died instantly. The posters that our distant neighbor had put up were a great kindness; otherwise we may never have known her fate.</p>\n<p>Pia was like the wild rocker of the pair; she lived hard and died young. We were sad then, but we were young and busy raising the first of our children as well. We had much to distract us from the loss. Our house was also in a densely populated residential area, so rather than burying her in our tiny yard, we opted to have Pia cremated. We had no specific plans about where or when to bury, and so she has resided in an urn on our bookcase ever since.</p>\n<p>In Pia’s absence, Mia came into her own as the quiet, methodical hunter that I will fondly remember. Her small size was no shortcoming in the business of mousing, but she was equally as gentle and loving with her humans. She lived out her best years in and around the house, occasionally tying up with other cats or critters in the neighborhood, but mostly just lording over the creatures in our own yard.</p>\n<p>For each of our children, during their infancy Mia showed incredible patience and tolerance with their poking and prodding. Her reactions were always tempered to a level that was appropriate to the age of the kids. At night, she could often be found curled up beside one of them. She would follow them up to the house of our friends and neighbors and wait for the kids outside (or even inside, on occasion).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few years ago we got the first indication that her kidneys were failing. We were able to manage this with special food and for her own part, Mia was still herself. Around a year ago, we had a much bigger scare when I found a large, open abscess on her abdomen. Our best guess is that this was the result of a scrape with one of the other animals in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The timing of her abdominal injury was tough; it came right in the midst of our house move and so we were making vet visits with her one hour and frantically packing the next. But eventually, everything settled out. Mia’s wound was treated and healing, and we were in the new house. Our vet, who had cared for both cats from the beginning, left us with stern instructions that Mia could no longer be an outdoor cat at the new place.</p>\n<p>At first, Mia didn’t take kindly to being sequestered, but she was slowing down and ultimately seemed to accept the indoor lifestyle. Part of me wonders now if she might have preferred to be outdoors at the end, but the lack of closure for our kids would have been pretty hard. It will be hard enough as it is.</p>\n<p>Over this past summer, my wife brought a new cat into the family. Mia and Pia were already around eight months old when they came to us, but this new cat was very much a young kitten.

The two likely causes were cancer, or congestive heart failure. In a cat that is already dealing with full blown kidney disease, both of these possibilities are pretty bad.

I spent a half hour Wednesday night just laying the bed with Mia laying on my chest, as comfortable as possible under the circumstances.

My wife let the kids know what was going to happen, and that it was time to start saying our goodbyes. That went about as well as you could expect.</p>\n<p>We skipped the kidney-friendly food.

She ate both with gusto.</p>\n<p>But this morning was tough; I don’t think the kids completely grasped that they would leave for school and Mia would be gone when they got home.

				"content_text": "We lost Mia today. I&rsquo;ve always read posts like this with some amount of indifference because in the back of my head I am thinking &ldquo;this is just an animal&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is not a person&rdquo;. And so I forgive you for feeling the same way. I understand that response.\n\nThis stream of thoughts is really for me, and it is also for my wife and kids and anyone else who feels the loss of our &ldquo;just a cat&rdquo; as acutely as I am feeling it right now. But maybe you&rsquo;ve been here, too, with your pets, at the end of a chapter in your own life. Here is a rememberance for us.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n---\n\nMia and her sister Pia came into our lives on March 15th, 2002. I remember this day well because it was the Ides of March and by an ironic coincidence, I spent that day at the enlistment center in Boston, signing up to join the Army National Guard. The cats were originally found in a cardboard box by a dumpster, and their age at the time that they came home to us was estimated to be eight months.\n\nWe had no children yet, we were both working, and I was going to be disappearing for two and a half months to go to basic training. My wife wanted (and still wants) a dog, but I knew our lifestyle couldn&rsquo;t work with dogs. Mia and Pia were the compromise.\n\nDespite being part of the same litter, Mia and Pia couldn&rsquo;t have been less alike. Pia was a long haired cat, mostly gray with dark streaks. Mia was the classic black and white tabby cat. Pia was a normal-sized, aggressive, dominating cat. Mia never grew past the size of a kitten, and spent her youth quietly in her sister&rsquo;s shadow.\n\nThe cats were raised to be indoor-outdoor cats and spent many a night out and about in our neighborhood. The extent of their range was not obvious to us until, a few years later, Pia had gone missing for a few days. A neighbor, some streets away from us, put up a poster about the dead cat they had found meeting Pia&rsquo;s description.\n\nI went to discover that Pia had been hit by a car and died instantly. The posters that our distant neighbor had put up were a great kindness; otherwise we may never have known her fate.\n\nPia was like the wild rocker of the pair; she lived hard and died young. We were sad then, but we were young and busy raising the first of our children as well. We had much to distract us from the loss. Our house was also in a densely populated residential area, so rather than burying her in our tiny yard, we opted to have Pia cremated. We had no specific plans about where or when to bury, and so she has resided in an urn on our bookcase ever since.\n\nIn Pia&rsquo;s absence, Mia came into her own as the quiet, methodical hunter that I will fondly remember. Her small size was no shortcoming in the business of mousing, but she was equally as gentle and loving with her humans. She lived out her best years in and around the house, occasionally tying up with other cats or critters in the neighborhood, but mostly just lording over the creatures in our own yard.\n\nFor each of our children, during their infancy Mia showed incredible patience and tolerance with their poking and prodding. Her reactions were always tempered to a level that was appropriate to the age of the kids. At night, she could often be found curled up beside one of them. She would follow them up to the house of our friends and neighbors and wait for the kids outside (or even inside, on occasion).\n\n---\n\nA few years ago we got the first indication that her kidneys were failing. We were able to manage this with special food and for her own part, Mia was still herself. Around a year ago, we had a much bigger scare when I found a large, open abscess on her abdomen. Our best guess is that this was the result of a scrape with one of the other animals in the neighborhood.\n\nThe timing of her abdominal injury was tough; it came right in the midst of our house move and so we were making vet visits with her one hour and frantically packing the next. But eventually, everything settled out. Mia&rsquo;s wound was treated and healing, and we were in the new house. Our vet, who had cared for both cats from the beginning, left us with stern instructions that Mia could no longer be an outdoor cat at the new place.\n\nAt first, Mia didn&rsquo;t take kindly to being sequestered, but she was slowing down and ultimately seemed to accept the indoor lifestyle. Part of me wonders now if she might have preferred to be outdoors at the end, but the lack of closure for our kids would have been pretty hard. It will be hard enough as it is.\n\nOver this past summer, my wife brought a new cat into the family. Mia and Pia were already around eight months old when they came to us, but this new cat was very much a young kitten. With Gus, as we&rsquo;ve come to call him, Mia made it clear from the start that she would not suffer to live again in another cat&rsquo;s shadow. Even when the kitten had grown to twice her size in six months, she held her ground against his frequent ambushes and games.\n\nThe squabbling was tiresome for Mia, but she had another big health problem brewing.

I don&rsquo;t believe that we could have stayed on top of the fine tuning that lies between the opposing treatment plans.

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://ello.co/\">Ello</a> is a social platform that has been the subject of some buzz recently. Either by design or by accident, Ello is squarely positioned as the anti-Facebook, which immediately places it in a similar space in people’s minds. That’s a great deal for Ello, because feature-wise they have a long way to go before the can really throw down: no mobile app, no OAuth, no API. Ello claims to be built on a Freemium model that will sustain the company without them resorting to selling user info; but only time will tell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"social-network-options-are-ever-increasing\">Social Network Options Are Ever-Increasing</h3>\n<p>The bigger issue for folks like myself, folks who like things neat and tidy and simple, is that this is Yet Another Social Network, in a space where there are already tons of players. I doubt this situation will change; nobody really wants One Site to Rule Them All. But as a content creator, I find myself asking the same question with everything that I write: where do I <em>post</em> this?</p>\n<p>For me, the answer seems to be divided along content / audience lines. I <em>think</em> that my tech audience is on G+ and my “human interest” audience is on Facebook. Twitter blurs the lines a bit; it is a popular platform for boosting people’s work agendas (including my own), but following anyone who only posts about work gets pretty dull.

				"content_text": "[Ello][1] is a social platform that has been the subject of some buzz recently. Either by design or by accident, Ello is squarely positioned as the anti-Facebook, which immediately places it in a similar space in people’s minds. That’s a great deal for Ello, because feature-wise they have a long way to go before the can really throw down: no mobile app, no OAuth, no API. Ello claims to be built on a Freemium model that will sustain the company without them resorting to selling user info; but only time will tell.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### Social Network Options Are Ever-Increasing\n\nThe bigger issue for folks like myself, folks who like things neat and tidy and simple, is that this is Yet Another Social Network, in a space where there are already tons of players. I doubt this situation will change; nobody really wants One Site to Rule Them All. But as a content creator, I find myself asking the same question with everything that I write: where do I _post_ this?\n\nFor me, the answer seems to be divided along content / audience lines. I _think_ that my tech audience is on G+ and my “human interest” audience is on Facebook. Twitter blurs the lines a bit; it is a popular platform for boosting people’s work agendas (including my own), but following anyone who only posts about work gets pretty dull. The jury’s out on Ello, but 24 hours into my Ello account and it is still pretty much a wasteland.\n\n### In Some Cases, Maybe It’s _Function_ Over Forum\n\nBlogging’s a little different for me.

				"title": "OS X to Fedora 20: The User Experience, Pt. 1",
				"content_html": "<p>A little background here: I have been a Mac enthusiast for a number of years now. I would not say that I am religious about OS X, but if the OS X user experience is a philosophical application of “<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/802050/what-is-opinionated-software\">opinionated</a> <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Make_Opinionated_Software.php\">software</a>”, then I find myself in agreement with most of the opinions that the Apple UX team has expressed.</p>\n<p>However, I am also an open source developer. I’d like to believe that it is possible to create a similar and possibly even superior experience with a Linux-based desktop environment. And lo, this is what lead me, a few weeks ago, to get Fedora 20 running on a MacBook Air. If you’re interested in trying the same thing, check out Matt Hicks’ <a href=\"http://mattoncloud.org/2014/02/05/fedora-20-on-a-macbook-air/\">invaluable blog post</a> on setting things up.</p>\n<p>Over a series of blog posts I am digging into my impressions of the Fedora 20 user experience as I work through this total switch-over.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-important-desktop-apps\">The Important Desktop Apps</h3>\n<p>I spend 95% of my computer time in front of the same 5 apps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A text editor</li>\n<li>A web browser</li>\n<li>A mail client</li>\n<li>A calendar client</li>\n<li>A chat client (specifically for IRC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I typically also have several helper apps that I call upon and I usually have music going in the background, but I cover “Cloud stuff” in the next part of this series.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-same-same-stuff\">The Same-Same Stuff</h3>\n<p>For my text editor and web browser, I’m using the same tools on both platforms: vim for text and Firefox for web. The experience of these between OS X and Fedora 20 is 99% identical. Not much else to say there.</p>\n<p>Now as you read on you may be thinking: “hey, you could have identical experiences all the way through if you just used <code>&lt;open_source_tool&gt;</code> in place of <code>&lt;os_x_native_tool&gt;</code>”. And you’d be right. But in the cases below, I really feel like the OS X native tool is a little better, and in each case I will attempt to explain why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-mail-client-mailapp-vs-thunderbird\">The Mail Client: Mail.app vs. Thunderbird</h3>\n<p>I don’t always think that the right answer is to make Linux match OS X, but when OS X does something really well, I wish the open-source equivalent could do the same. In the case of <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/\">Thunderbird</a>, the functionality that I desire is frustratingly close, but not quite there.

				"content_text": "A little background here: I have been a Mac enthusiast for a number of years now. I would not say that I am religious about OS X, but if the OS X user experience is a philosophical application of “[opinionated][1] [software][2]”, then I find myself in agreement with most of the opinions that the Apple UX team has expressed.\n\nHowever, I am also an open source developer. I’d like to believe that it is possible to create a similar and possibly even superior experience with a Linux-based desktop environment. And lo, this is what lead me, a few weeks ago, to get Fedora 20 running on a MacBook Air. If you’re interested in trying the same thing, check out Matt Hicks’ [invaluable blog post][3] on setting things up.\n\nOver a series of blog posts I am digging into my impressions of the Fedora 20 user experience as I work through this total switch-over.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### The Important Desktop Apps\n\nI spend 95% of my computer time in front of the same 5 apps:\n\n  * A text editor\n  * A web browser\n  * A mail client\n  * A calendar client\n  * A chat client (specifically for IRC)\n\nI typically also have several helper apps that I call upon and I usually have music going in the background, but I cover “Cloud stuff” in the next part of this series.\n\n### The Same-Same Stuff\n\nFor my text editor and web browser, I’m using the same tools on both platforms: vim for text and Firefox for web. The experience of these between OS X and Fedora 20 is 99% identical. Not much else to say there.\n\nNow as you read on you may be thinking: “hey, you could have identical experiences all the way through if you just used `<open_source_tool>` in place of `<os_x_native_tool>`”. And you’d be right. But in the cases below, I really feel like the OS X native tool is a little better, and in each case I will attempt to explain why.\n\n### The Mail Client: Mail.app vs. Thunderbird\n\nI don’t always think that the right answer is to make Linux match OS X, but when OS X does something really well, I wish the open-source equivalent could do the same. In the case of [Thunderbird][4], the functionality that I desire is frustratingly close, but not quite there. Specifically, I am talking about the way that Mail.app handles threaded e-mail discussions, both in the e-mails list and the email display field.\n\nTo Thunderbird’s credit, you can edit the columns displayed in the e-mails list, turn on threaded views, and Thuderbird even kinda sorta shows an all-discussion view of the thread. But Mail.app’s multi-line mail list entries make for a narrower emails listing field, and the all-discussion view still shows complete, distinct e-mails from the thread – including your own e-mails which may have gone to the Sent folder but still count as part of the conversation1. Thunderbird doesn’t do this even though [someone first raised this issue in 2003 and people have periodically asked for it ever since][5].\n\nBut while the threaded views leave something to be desired, I will be the first to say that **Thunderbird’s e-mail search is awesome**. It is very fast, includes a cool chart of word hits by year, and shows enough of each e-mail in the search result to give better context for the word being searched.\n\nThunderbird isn’t the only mail client for Fedora; in fact, it isn’t even the default client for Fedora. But while [Evolution][6] offers a very Outlook-like experience, the Outlook that it emulates is Outlook 2003. I don’t want to get into a colors and buttons argumnt, but Evolution looks pretty dated and has similar problems to Thunderbird with regard to offering an information-dense layout. Moreover:\n\n  * Evolution lacks the sort of plugin ecosystem that Thunderbird has. These plugins add a ton of value and help Thunderbird to stay current as new kinds of web services arise.\n\n  * Evolution doesn’t allow you to map mail boxes to known roles, like for instance having an Archive folder. So if you aren’t using Gmail and you want Archive-like behavior, Evolution isn’t for you.\n\n### The Calendar Client: Calendar.app vs. Lightning\n\nI’d love to be proven wrong, but as far as I can tell, nothing in the open-source space can even come close to what Apple, Google and Microsoft have done with their calendaring apps. I understand that doing calendaring correctly is a really hard problem, but the net result is that on the client side, open source systems seem to be limited to only the most basic functionality.\n\nIf you only keep calendars for yourself, this is probably not an issue. But for anyone who wants to schedule a meeting or have access to delegate calendars, you are going to run into problems. For this reason, and because I’d already chosen Thunderbird over Evolution, it seemed logical to pick [Lightning][7] for e-mail. Lightning is “good enough” for showing me my schedule at a glance, but doesn’t distinguish itself as being a more functional calendar app than any of the other Linux options (like Evolution, or even the nascent [California][8]).\n\n### The IRC Chat Client: LimeChat vs. HexChat\n\nI use [ZNC][9] as a proxy server for several IRC servers where I hang out on a daily basis. ZNC’s primary job is to keep a log of the discussion on the channels that I follow so that if I miss something, I can read about it and follow up later. In order for my ZNC server to know which real IRC server I want to connect to, I need use a log name of the form:\n\n```\n<znc_username>/<znc_config_name>\n``` \n\nWell, you’d be surprised to find out how many IRC clients can’t tolerate a `/` in your username. On OS X, this drove me right into the arms of [LimeChat][10]. I’m really glad it did, too, because the information density jammed into LimeChat’s subdued interface is totally amazing.\n\nMany IRC clients on Fedora 20 suffer the same username handling problem, but HexChat stands out for being able to connect to VNC.

In the center of the room, my wife and her parents are gathered around Elena&rsquo;s bed. Home and Garden television has been droning on for hours at one end of the room; we are all interior design experts now and we barely notice anymore. The sun outside is bright, but the breeze is surprisingly cold. Elena has been burning up for days, but today it is cool enough that we don&rsquo;t need to run the AC in her window.</p>\n<p>Last night, Elena&rsquo;s meds were discontinued. She&rsquo;s on morphine, now. She has a button that gives her more if she needs it, but she hasn&rsquo;t been lucid enough to use it. Today was a quiet day. I spent my working hours in the next room. Two of Elena&rsquo;s friends came by and spent some hours around her bed.</p>\n<p>The drone of the television is lost under singing. Elena stirs long enough to watch my daughter singing to her. For a moment, the whole family is smiling, and just as quickly, Elena drifts back into her half-sleep. The smiles slowly fade, but Linnea is still signing. And I am still watching them as their gazes return to Elena. I am watching all of the love and prayers.

				"content_text": "(This post is about Elena. Shes not doing very well. I invite you to read this, but I don't want you to have to.)\n\nI am sitting on a couch. In the center of the room, my wife and her parents are gathered around Elena's bed. Home and Garden television has been droning on for hours at one end of the room; we are all interior design experts now and we barely notice anymore. The sun outside is bright, but the breeze is surprisingly cold. Elena has been burning up for days, but today it is cool enough that we don't need to run the AC in her window.\n\nLast night, Elena's meds were discontinued. She's on morphine, now. She has a button that gives her more if she needs it, but she hasn't been lucid enough to use it. Today was a quiet day. I spent my working hours in the next room. Two of Elena's friends came by and spent some hours around her bed. \n\nThe drone of the television is lost under singing. Elena stirs long enough to watch my daughter singing to her. For a moment, the whole family is smiling, and just as quickly, Elena drifts back into her half-sleep. The smiles slowly fade, but Linnea is still signing. And I am still watching them as their gazes return to Elena. I am watching all of the love and prayers. Tears are streaming down my face and I quietly slip from the room.\n\nElena had no tolerance for visitors who wanted to sit in her room and sob and wring their hands over what is happening to her. She'd made her peace with the cancer and what it was going to do to her and didn't need to dwell on it. I am standing in the hallway now. We'll get brief glimpses of her in the next few days.

				"content_html": "<p>Last weekend I had the privilege of DJing at the wedding of some friends. I&rsquo;ve unofficially DJed a few parties, but never something as involved (and DJ-dependant) as a life-changing ceremony followed by several hours of dancing. Annika will tell you that I spent a lot of the preceeding week in a heightened state of, well, being nervous as hell.</p>\n<p>Before I go much further, let me say that the DJing went well. The ceremony went smoothly, no worries with the random playlist through cocktail hour, and once we got into the post-dinner dancing portion of the evening, I really started to have a lot of fun. The bride and groom seemed happy, no one threatened me. Some of the other wedding guests, themselves veterans of many a sound check, helped me move audio equipment around as events dictated.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not really what Im writing about, though. I was ready for all of that stuff&ndash;I&rsquo;d practiced aspects of the whole set, I knew the (few) tricky sound cues. But what I didn&rsquo;t realize during all of my preparations was that I was building a mental model of what people would want to dance to that was subtly incorrect. I had brought enough of the &ldquo;right&rdquo; kind of music to cover my mistake, but the more I reflect on the whole thing, the more I believe that I was being shown a basic truth about the way we become older.</p>\n<p>Consider, for a minute, Rob Base&rsquo;s seminal work &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;re under thirty and you&rsquo;re not familiar with this track, then think about Fergie&rsquo;s &ldquo;London Bridge&rdquo; and imagine that it is still popular in 2024. Why 2024? Because that&rsquo;s when &ldquo;London Bridge&rdquo; will be a song that is 18 years old, just like &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo; is right now. Let me say that again for those of you who are still thinking about Rob Base: &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo; was released in 1988. If you were on the dance floor last Saturday night at the wedding I DJed, then you probably first danced to &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo; at a high school prom. Or maybe you heard it coming out of the speakers of someone&rsquo;s boom box.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason, the song stuck with you. The repetitive scream that is part of the underlying breakbeat is no longer edgy and urban. Now it&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s funky. You can dance to it. And you know, I love a fun old dance tune as much as the next wedding guest. But I had assumed that everyone&rsquo;s tastes had followed an evolutionary line that also included fun <em>new</em> dance tunes as well as some of the other less mainstream style-descendants of Rob Base, Ini Kamoze (the Hotstepper), and Sir Mix-a-Lot.</p>\n<p>Not so, dear reader. I don&rsquo;t think the human brain works like that. People go to <em>clubs</em> to hear the hot new tracks, not weddings. Weddings are those times when the fondest old memories get fished out of the bin and strung together into newer fond old memories. You can add a wrinkle here or there, but you&rsquo;ll never mix BTs &ldquo;Circles&rdquo; into a party based on the likes of &ldquo;Groove is in the Heart&rdquo; (16 years old), &ldquo;O.P.P.&rdquo; (15 years old), and &ldquo;Push It&rdquo; (20 years old). Now, in everyone&rsquo;s defense, yes, newer songs were played and danced to with vigor. But the set wouldn&rsquo;t have been right without the older songs. There&rsquo;s something about them that adds context to the event. It says: &ldquo;this is the fun for <em>us</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I know it wasnt the fun for the under-ten set at the wedding because I was repeatedly asked by some of the kids when I was going to play &ldquo;something cool&rdquo;. I shudder to think of what&rsquo;s cool music to a ten year old boy. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was in full-on Weird Al worship at ten, and that&rsquo;s just not a good avenue for a wedding DJ to follow.</p>\n<p>This gets a little philosophical when you step back and think about how much of what you do can be fixed to a particular not-necessarily-recent point in time. All of the stupid ad jingles you&rsquo;ve learned. All of the clothing trends that you can recall (though of course, <em>you</em> never dressed that way). Something finds its way into your brain and it stays there. Random happenstance occasionally pulls it up and suddenly on the dance floor youre letting out a primal yell because &ldquo;Rock Lobster&rdquo; (27 years old) is, like, totally your favorite song. (The system works. Writing &ldquo;like, totally&rdquo; got me thinking about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Girl\">Valley Girls</a>.)</p>\n<p>Right now, we&rsquo;ve still got some choices&ndash;we can see that divide between Now and Then. But it gets a lot harder after your brain gets added to the &ldquo;untrustworthy body parts&rdquo; list. One of Annika&rsquo;s grandfathers has repeatedly told me of a particular war-era adventure of his; he forgets that I know the story well. And whenever he tells me the story, I think about the fact that this particular adventure must have contained some of the greatest moments of his life, because he can&rsquo;t always remember the names and faces of his family, but that story lives on the tip of his tongue. To me the real kicker is that he&rsquo;s telling this to his second generation of offspring, and godwilling he&rsquo;ll tell it to the third as well. How could his adventures be any more amazing that seeing a room filled with generations of people who can trace themselves back to <em>him</em>? What does the past possess that is so much more valuable than <em>right now</em>?</p>\n<p>Happily, for the bride and groom at most modern, mutually-embarked-upon weddings, there is nothing but the Now. There&rsquo;s so much Now for them that there isn&rsquo;t room for anything else. If you do anything approaching a traditional wedding and reception these days, your wedding day is the longest Now you&rsquo;ll ever have. But for everyone else, the Now is a little more lovely with a side order of Then.</p>\n<p>I felt a little bad for the wedding guest who got really excited when I mixed in Steve Miller band. It was during a lull before the die hard hip-hop dance crowd layed seige to the dance floor. But in forty years, when Steve Miller and 50 Cent end up on the same &ldquo;Greatest Hits of the Late 1900s&rdquo; compilation, we&rsquo;ll all be there doing the robot while the current hip generation shakes its head in pity. We&rsquo;ll have a choice then, too, of course. We&rsquo;ll choose between hobbling off the dance floor to reflect on how much more awesome our music was and staying on to catch a few measures of what the hip ones are listening to. And if the DJ takes that opportunity to pull out &ldquo;Love Shack&rdquo;&hellip; well, that&rsquo;ll be okay, too :-)</p>\n",
